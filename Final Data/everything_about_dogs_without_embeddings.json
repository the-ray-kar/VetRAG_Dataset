Even  when  force  is  necessary  there  is  no  need \nfor  opening  a  dog's  teeth  when  liquid  is  to  be  given,  for  if  poured  into  the \npatient's  cheek  it  will  drain  through  the  teeth.  When  a  dog  refuses  to  swal- \nlow whatever  is  placed  in  his  mouth — as  he  is  liable  to  do — all  that  is  neces- \nsary is  to  hold  his  head  up  and  close  his  nostrils  and  jaws  for  a  couple  of \nseconds. \n\nGiving  pills  to  some  dogs  is  a  more  difficult  matter.  Hold  the  dog's \nhead  well  up,  open  mouth  with  your  left  hand,  and  place  the  pill  well  down \nhis  throat  on  the  base  of  the  tongue,  quickly  close  his  jaws  for  a  second \nand  slightly  chuck  your  hand  or  finger  agaist  his  throat  and  he  is  bound \nto  make  a  gulp  and  swallow  it.  Some  dogs  are  very  cute  and  will  keep  the \npill  inside  or  on  one  side  and  when  you  are  not  looking  will  quickly  spit \nit  out,  so  watch  them  for  a  minute  or  so  to  be  sure  the  pill  has  gone  down. \nPills  can  also  be  given  hid  in  a  piece  of  meat  (providing  the  dog  is  not  so \nsick  that  he  has  refused  food),  but  if  you  give  them  pills  this  way,  fool \nthe  dog  by  giving  him  first  a  few  pieces  of  meat  one  at  a  time,  having  your \nprepared  piece  handy  when  he  will  not  suspect  and  will  take  it,  following \nit  up  with  a  few  more  pieces  of  meat. \n\nA  great  many  dogs  will  take — when  not  too  sick — castor  oil,  cod  liver \noil,  syrup  of  phosphates,  and  many  powders  even,  in  a  little  savory  broth  or \nporridge.  When  powders  are  refused  in  food,  mix  them  in  a  little  butter, \nhoney  or  syrup,  and  place  well  back  on  the  tongue.  With  l",

With  large  and  pow- \nerful dogs  the  mouth  can  be  held  open  by  twisting  a  towel  around  the \nupper  jaw,  and  an  assistant  is  generally  necessary  except  with  small  toy \ndogs,  which  can  be  held  tightly  between  the  knees  while  giving  the  med- \nicine. As  soon  as  the  medicine  is  placed  on  the  tongue,  close  the  mouth \nand  hold  it  shut  till  dog  is  seen  to  swallow,  but  must  not  be  held  so  as  to \ninterfere  with  his  breathing  through  the  nostrils.  The  best  way  to  give \nliquid  medicine  is  to  gently  raise  the  dog's  head  and  form  a  pouch  or  pocket \nby  drawing  outwards  -and  slightly  upwards  the  lower  lip  at  the  corner  of \nthe  mouth,  and  gradually  pouring  into  the  funnel  thus  formed. \n\nGelatine  capsuls  are  very  handy  in  administering  powders.

The  ordinary  bulb  syringe  or  those  of  the  hard  rubber \nvariety  can  be  used  for  this  purpose,  but  the  nozzle  must  not  be  pointed \nenough  to  injure  the  mucus  membrane  as  abrasions  of  the  latter  might \nprove  troublesome. \n\nIn  connection  with  the  administration  of  medicine,  it  will  be  well  to \nremember  that  all  drugs  act  more  powerfully  on  an  empty  stomach  than \nwhen  it  holds  food,  either  liquid  or  solid.  Therefore,  powerful  remedies  and \nthose  which  are  of  irritating  character,  such,  as  arsenic,  iron,  nux  vomica \nand  cod-liver  oil,  should  be  given  after  feeding,  so  that  they  will  mingle \n\"with  the  food  and  be  absorbed  slowly.  Oil  can  be  administered  easily  if \nfloated  on  milk.  Whisky,  alcohol  and  all  fluids  of  strong  taste  should  be \nfreely  diluted  with  water  before  administering,  at  least  four  parts  of  water \nto  one  of  whisky. "

            "\n\nBREEDING  AND  RAISING  OF  PUPPIES \n\n\nBitches  come  in  season  on  an  average  of  twice  a  year,  about  every  five \nto  seven  months,  and  the  question  is  often  asked  whether  it  is  advisable \nto  bceed  a  bitch  during  the  first  period  of  oestrum.  The  answer  depends \nmuch  upon  the  breed  and  state  of  maturity.  As  a  general  thing,  it  is  not \nwell  for  a  young  bitch,  which  can  not  be  fully  developed  at  the  age  of  ten \nmonths,  to  undergo  the  strain  on  vitality,  which  maternity  causes.  Some \nterriers  mature  quickly,  but  the  large  breeds  should  certainly  not  be  bred \nuntil  at  least  eighteen  months  old,  and  in  any  case  it  is  wise  to  allow  the \nfirst  period  to  pass. \n\nAnother  question  asked,  is  whether  a  bitch  should  be  bred  at  every \nperiod,  or  rather,  whether  it  is  wise  to  do  so.  This  depends  a  good  deal \nupon  the  vigor  of  the  bitch,  but  unless  a  bitch  be  looked  upon  as  a  mere \nmachine  to  produce  puppies  for  the  benefit  of  the  owner's  pocket,  it  is  well \nto  allow  the  bitch  to  be  served  every  other  period.  When  a  bitch  is  bred \ntwice  a  year  and  has  a  litter  each  time,  the  strain  upon  her  vitality  must  be \nvery  great,  and  unless  the  mother  is  more  than  ordinarily  vigorous,  later \nlitters  will  show  a  corresponding  weakness. \n\nA  bitch  first  shows  signs  of  coming  in  season  by  bleeding.  Now,  if  you \nare  watching  for  her  and  take  note  of  the  clay  the  bleeding  begins,  then \none  method  to  determine  when  she  is  ready  to  take  the  dog  is  to  count \nfrom  this  day,  and  from  the  tenth  to  twelfth  day  she  is  ready  for  the  dog. \nThis  rule  does  not  always  work,  however,  for  I've  had  bitches  that  were  ready \nand  willing  to  be  served  even  in  the  sixth  day  and  yet  others  would  not  take \nthe  dog  till  the  fifteenth  day.",

            "\nAsthma. — This  is  a  common  disease  and  a  most  distressing  complaint, \nits  victims  being  mostly  found  among  house  pets  and  toy  dogs  that  have \nbeen  overfed  with  a  too  rich  diet,  and  lack  of  exercise  as  well.  Almast  every \ntoy  dog  so  improperly  cared  for  and  fed  will  develop  asthma  as  they  get \nalong  in  years.  The  grossness  of  body  induces  and  fosters  it  and  often \ncauses  as  well  a  kind  of  scurvy  mange,  the  coat  feeling  harsh  and  dry  with \na  rough  and  dirty  look.  The  symptoms  are  distressing  paroxysms  of  cough- \ning with  great  difficulty  in  breathing,  which  occur  frequently.  The  symp- \ntoms exhibited  are  due  to 'thickening  of  the  mucus  lining  of  the  trachea  and \nbronchial  tubes  which  by  lessening  the  calibre  of  the  respiratory  tract  in- \nterferes with  the  act  of  breathing  which  is  attended  by  a  loud,  wheezing \nnoise.  The  blood  is  imperfectly  aereated  and  the  visible  mucous  mem- \nbranes congested  and  dark  in  color.  Pugs  and  aged  Spaniels  seem  pre- \ndisposed to  asthmatic  troubles,  which,  while  not  usually  fatal,  do  not \nprove  amenable  to  treatment. \n\nAn  important  feature  of  the  treatment  is  attention  to  the  diet,  which \nshould  be  of  a  non-stimulating  character.  First  relieve  the  animal  by  giving \nthe  following  antispasmotic  drops:  Compound  spirits  of  sulphuric  ether  and \ntincture  of  opium,  equal  parts,  which  keep  in  a  cool  place  and  well  corked. \n\n\n \n\nThe  dose  for  a  15-lb.  to  30-lb.  dog  would  be  a  small  teaspoonful  in  a  couple \nof  tablespoonfuls  of  gruel  o'r  milk.  This,  however,  only  relieves  and  does \nnot  cure.  The  dog  must  now  have  frequent  doses  of  a  brisk  aperient,  and \na  pill  of  the  following  prescription  will  be  found  very  beneficial  given  every \nnight  for  a  while: \n\nPodophyllin    6    grains \n\nCompound  extra",

He  also  gives  the  'coeffi- \ncient of  efficacy'  in  the  same  percentage  as  the  article  you  have  quoted. \nHe  gives  the  following  mode  of  administration:  First  day— Liquid  diet; \n8  p.  m.  one  ounce  Epsom  salts.  Second  day — Omit  .breakfast  and  lunch; \nat  5  a.  m.  one  ounce  of  Epsom  salts;  at  7,  9  and  11,  sixteen  drops  of  oil \nchenopodium  on  a  little  granulated  sugar;  1  p.  m.  one  ounce  castor  oil \ncontaining  fifty  minims  of  chloroform;  soft  supper  (this  for  a  dog  would \nbe  a  little  baker's  bread  soaked  in   milk).      Third  day — Resume  full  diet.\" \n\nAnother  southern   writer  has   this  to  say: \n\n\"While  it  has  not  been  definitely  determined  whether  or  not  this  dis- \nease is  due  to  hookworm  infestment,  indications  suggest  a  very  close  relation, \nas  postmortem  examinations  have  shown  hookworms  and  great  intestinal \ninflammation.  Ii  is  probable  that  the  toxin  which  the  hookworm  injects \ninto  the  dog's  blood  may  cause  the  disease.  It  is  not  contagious,  nor \ncan  it  be  communicated  by  feeding  or  drinking  from  the  same  vessel.  An \nexperiment  was  recently  made  by  feeding  parts  of  stomach  and  intestines \nof  a  dog  which  died  of  an  acute  case  of  black  tongue  to  several  healthy \ndogs,  and  no  ill  effects  developed.

This  may \nbe  done  a  third  and  even  a  fourth  time,  if  the  cough  does  not  disappear. \nDo  not  physic  every  day  or  you  will  weaken  the  animal  too  much,  but  allow \ntwo  or  three  days  to  pass.\" \n\nCuts,  Tears  or  Wounds. — The  first  thing  to  be  done  is  to  stop  the \nbleeding,  which  can  generally  be  done  by  simple  pressure  with  the  fingers, \nor  by  a  few  folds  of  lint  pressed  firmly  against  the  cut.  Unless  a  consid- \nerable artery  has  been  severed,  these  means  are  generally  successful,  but  if \nsuch  is  the  case,  a  ligature  will  be  the  cure.  After  bleeding  is  partially  or \nentirely  stopped,  remove  all  foreign  bodies,  such  as  glass,  dirt,  thorns  or \nsplinters,  but  avoid  using  very  cold  or  hot  water  in  doing  so,  having  it  about \nblood  warm.  If  the  cut  or  wound  is  superficial,  the  cleansing,  pressing \nof  the  parts  together  and  dressing  it  with  friars  balsam  or  tincture  of \nmyrrh,  applied  with  a  small  brush  or  feather,  will  be  all  that  is  required, \nthe  using  of  these  tinctures  leaving  on  the  wound  a  protective  covering \nof  gum.  If  the  lips  of  the  wound  will  not  meet,  draw  them  together  with \na  few  stitches,  using  a  slightly  curved  suture  needle  and  a  silk  thread \nwhich  should  be  waxed  with  beeswax  to  prevent  absorption  and  its  acting \nas  a  seaton.  Sewing  up  wounds  is  easy.

Do  each \nstitch  separately.

It  is  advisable  to  muzzle  the  dog  afterwards  or  keep  on  a \nlight  bandage  to  keep  the  dog  from  biting  off  the  threads  and  undoing  the \nstitches  with  his  mouth  and.  tongue.

I  always  adopt \n\n\n\nthe  plan  of  reserving  bones  until  after  the  clogs  have  fed,  for  if  given  with \nthe  other  food  they  are  at  once  picked  out,  and  the  smaller  ones  are, \nwhen  the  dog  is  hungry,  apt  to  be  swallowed  unmasticated  and  produce \nchoking. \n\nTreatment. — Frequently  by  manipulating  the  throat  outside  with  the \nfingers  the  obstruction  can  be  worked  down  the  gullet,  or  if  it  can  be  felt \nin  the  upper  part  of  the  throat,  it  may  be  removed  by  the  throat  forceps, \nwhich  most  veterinary  surgeons  keep  by  them.

In  using  this  extra  care  must  be  taken  that  the  sponge  is  so  firmly \nattached  to  the  whalebone  that  it  cannot  slip  off,  for  if  swallowed  it  might \neffectually  block  up  one  of  the  smaller  intestines;  therefore,  cut  nitches \nin  the  whalebone,  into  which- tie  the  piece  of  sponge",

The \npractice  of  leaving  stale  food  from  one  meal  to  another  is  a  common  source \nof  this  disease.  Diarrhea  may  be  classed  as  acute  and  chronic.

This  will  be  followed \nby  more  or  less  inflammation  of  the  mucous  membrane  lining  the  eye- \nlids, which  is  attended  by  a  watery  discharge  at  first  and  assuming  a  more \npurulent  condition  as  the  trouble  increases. \n\nIt  is  well  known  that  a  small  particle  of  grit  may  remain  under  an \neyelid  in  spite  of  fomentations,  and  should  the  eye  be  examined  without \ndiscovery  of  the  source  of  trouble,  very  often  an  application  of  pure  olive \noil  with  a   camel's  hair  brush   to   the   underpart  of  the   eyelid   Avill   often \n\n\nsucceed  in  carrying  off  the  irritant,  which  may  be  too  small  to  discern. \nThis,  however,  is  usually  to  be  considered  merely  a  preliminary  step,  and \nmy  Eye  Lotion  No.  2  should  be  then  used  to  remove  the  inflammation  thus \ncaused.  If  your  dog  brings  about  a  swollen  or  inflamed  condition  of  the \neyelids  through  a  chance  scratch  of  the  claws  in  rubbing  their  face,  use \nmy  Eye  Lotion  No.  2,  after  having  first  bathed  the  parts  with  warm  water. \nDifferent  form  of  indigestion  may  be  associated  with  irritation  of  the \nmucous  membranes  throughout,  and  the  eyes  will  suffer  in  common  with \nthe  other",

Rheumatism  is  also  one  of  the  maladies  which  are  at- \ntended with  inflammation,  more  or  less  pronounced,  of  the  eyes,  with  the \neyeball  itself  and  the  lids  participating  in  the  disorder.  It  must,  therefore, \nbe  obvious  that  the  common  expression,  \"a  discharge  from  the«eyes,\"  may \nrefer  to  a  variety  of  morbid  conditions  which  are  not  to  be  counteracted \nby  an  application  of  a  lotion  to  the  eye.  Perhaps  a  safe  guide  for  the \ntyro  in  medicine  may  be  found  in  the  duration  of  the  discharge.  In  any \ncase  of  simple  irritation  from  the  presence  of  dirt  or  grit  it  may  be  fairly  ex- \npected that  the  symptoms  will  cease  very  quickly  upon  the  application  of \nsimple  remedies,  that  is  to  say  after  it  has  been  clearly  ascertained  that \nthere  is  no  offending  body  adherent  to  the  underneath  part  of  the  eyelid. \nThe  continuance  of  the  discharge  week  after  week,",

Sporting  dogs  have  been  said  to \nbe  more  liable  to  it  than  other  breeds,  but  I  do  not  think  so,  and  I  believe \nthe  idea  originated  from  the  fact  that  these  have  generally  been  more  ex- \nposed to  circumstances  exciting  it  than  other  breeds.  From  my  own  exper- \nience, I  am  inclined  to  think  it  is  more  prevalent  in  pugs  and  other  pets \noverfed,  and  consequently  liable  to  frequent  derangement  of  the  digestive \norgans. \n\nAnything  that  will  set  up  local  irritation,  as  the  intrusion  of  dust,  flies, \netc.,  or  the  scratch  of  a  cat,  or  a  blow,  exposure  to  sudden  and  extreme \nchanges  of  temperature- — as  plunging  into  or  being  thrown  into  cold  water \nwhen  heated — and  excessive  exertion  is  occasionally  a  cause,  but  the  most \ncommon   sources   are   the   vapors   of   foul   kennels   or   hot   stables,   and   de- \n\n\nrangement  of  the  digestive  organs;  an  inverted  eyelash  may  occasion  it. \n\nOpthalmia  is  very  often  an  accompaniment  of  distemper.  There,  is  one \nform  of  disease  which  is  attended  with  considerable  discharge  from  the \neyes  undoubtedly  possessing  contagious  qualities.  This  affection  is  known \nas  contagious  optbalmia.  Perhaps  the  most  marked  illustration  of  this  va- \nriety of  the  affection  in  the  dog  is  that  which  is  associated  with  distemper, \nand  it  may  be  noted  here  that  by  the  term  opthalmia  is  meant  the  disease \nwhich  implicates  the  eyeball  itself. \n\nThe  symptoms  are  an  intolerance  of  light  and  a  watery  discharge, \nand  on  the  eyelids  be",

Treatment  must  to  some \nextent  be  governed  by  circumstances  of  each  case. \n\nThe  invariable  yellow  color  of  the  parts  mentioned  as  a  symptom  in \nthis  disease  is  one  which  the  least  careful  observer  cannot  fail  to  notice; \nbut  before  this  occurs  there  are  other  symptoms  which  should  not  be \noverlooked.  In  the  earlier  stages  the  dog's  appetite  fails;  he  suffers  con- \nsiderable thirst  which  increases  as  the  disease  progreses;  there  is  fever, \nwith  alternate  fits  of  heat  and  shivering;  vomiting  may  occur,  and  the \nmatter  ejected  is  generally  slimy  and  of  a  yellowish  color;  the  urine  is \npassed  in  small  quantities,  and  is  a  deep  yellow  color;  the  bowels  are \ngenerally  constipated,  and  the  excrement  is  of  a  pale  clay  color.

The  fixed  position  of  the  ribs,  with  the  heaving  of  the \nflanks,  is  a  most  characteristic  symptom  of  pleurisy.  In  affections  of  the \nlungs,  the  animal  stands  with  its  legs  (fore  legs)  wide  apart.  If  the  dis- \nease progresses,  the  face  has  a  haggard  expression,  the  angle  of  the  mouth \nis  drawn  up,  and  the  extremities  become  deathly  cold.  If  not  relieved,  the \ndog  rapidly  gets  worse,  and  the  breathing  becomes  more  labored  and  painful. \n\nPleurisy,  or  inflammation  of  the  investing  membrane  of  the  lungs,  often \nexists  independently,  or  as  a  complication  of  pneumonia.

In  fact,  whether  the  pneumonia  is  or  is  hot  accom- \npanied by  pleurisy  there  is  always  some  risk  of  a  fatal  termination. \n\nPneumonia  admits  of  no  delay  in  management,  but  must  be  treated \nal  once  i> v  giving  a  solution  of  acetate  of  ammonia  to  reduce  the  fever-— \n\n\nGERMAN  SHEPHERD  DOGS \n\n\nELHVIEW  KENNELS \n\nELMHURST,  PA. \n\n=  THE  HOME  OF  THE  CHAMPIONS  = \n\n\n1NTERNATIONAL  CHAMPION  APPOLLO  VON  HUNENSTEIN  P.H. \n\n\nWe  can  supply  dogs  of  all  ages  for  show,  pets  or  work. \nThe  greatest  selection  of  stud  dogs  in  this  country. \n\nAT  STl  1>. \n\nInternational  Champion  Apollo  von  Hunenstein,   Champion  Austria. \n1913,  Belgium  1913,  French  1914. \n\nChampion  of  record  in  America FEE  $50.00 \n\nChampion   Nero   Affolter    FEE    $50.00 \n\nFor  further  information  write \n\n512  SCRANTON  LIFE  BLDG.,   SCRANTON,  PA. \n\n\n \n\ncastor  oil  having  first  been  given  in  a  liberal  dose.

A  fort- \nnight or  three  weeks  is  about  the  limit  after  service,  but  they  have  been \ntreated  without  bad  result  within  three  weeks  of  whelping. \n\nIf  you  have  your  puppies  confined  in  a  yard  it  is  very  easy  to  watch \ntheir  passages,  and  this  is  one  of  the  surest  ways  of  all;  then,  as  soon  as \nyou  see  mucus  or  worms  passed  you  know  they  have  them,  and  can  go  to \nwork  at  once  to  treat  them.

It  is  the  hardest  subject  I  have \nto  handle  in  this  book,  and  as  too  much  information  on  this  dreaded  dis- \nease we  cannct  know,  I  have  secured  for  this  article  about  all  I  could  get. \nRead  and  study  up  this  subject  before  distemper  appears,  so  as  to  be  then \nprepared  to  attend  to  it  when  your  dogs  are  so' unfortunate  as  to  have  it. \nIt  is  not  a  foregone  conclusion  that  a  dog  must  die,  because  he  has  dis- \ntemper; I  have  had  many  dogs  get  it  and  get  well,  and  I  now  have  dogs \nin  my  kennel  that  got  safely  over  it,  and-  these  same  dogs  afterwards  ex- \nposed to  it  several-  times  and  did  not  again  have  it.  As  to  this,  I  believe \nthat  it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  a  grown  dog  will  have  it  the  second \ntime,  if  exposed,  any  more  than  a  man  is  in  danger  of  getting  smallpox \nafter  having  passed  safely  through  it.  Lately  I  had  two  cases  of  distemper \nin  my  kennel,  one  being  a  boarder,  a  Cocker  spaniel,  and  the  other,  one \nof  my  own  poodles,  both  young  dogs  of  six  months.  Unfortunately  both \ncases  proved  fatal,  but  I  checked  it  up  here  and  not  another  one  of  the \nfifty  other  dogs  in  the  kennel  had  it  at  all,  which  was  indeed  lucky,  as  it \nwas  impossible  to  prevent  most  of  them  from  exposure  at  the  first  stages \nof  the  disease  when  these  two  were  taken  down  with  it.  What  I  did  do, \nhowever,  was  to  immediately  take  steps  to  prevent,  especially  the  young- \ner dogs  from  getting  it.

We  cannot  get  too \nmuch   knowledge   on  this   disease: \n\n\"As  soon  as  the  disease  makes  its  appearance  the  affected  animal \nshould  be  placed  in  specially  prepared  quarters,  which  are  dry  and  well \nventilated,  but  free  from  drafts  and  not  liable  to  great  changes  in  tem- \nperature. Unless  the  weather  is  warm  abundant  bedding  of  wheat  straw \nshould  be  supplied,  and  the  patient  made  as  comfortable  as  possible.  Dis- \ninfectants should  be  in   constant   use. \n\n\"The  bedding  should  be  changed  at  least  once  each  day,  and  oftener, \nif  the  patient  is  greatly  prostrated  and  unable  to  move  about.  It  is  also \nbest  to  slightly  darken  the  quarters  so  that  the  patient  may  not  be  dis- \nturbed by  the  light  or  the  flies,  which  are  apt  to  congregate  about  him. \n\n\"As  the  disease  progresses  it  is  probable  that  the  dog's  appetite  will \nfail,  and  while  at  first  he  may  eat  sparingly  of  finely  chopped  meat,  broth \nthickened  with  rice,,  or  toasted  bread  or  slightly  heated  milk,  the  time  may \ncome  when  he  will ",

            "\nFeeding. — Here  is  an  important  subject  which  should  be  well  understood. \nNo  dog  over  six  months  old  should  ever  have  over  two  meals'  per  day,  and \nregularity  in  eating  is  just  as  important  in  dogs  as  it  is  in  human  beings. \nDogs  should  have  plain  food,  but  don't  be  afraid  of  giving  them  some  meat \nonce  a  day,  cooked,  and  cut  up  small,  avoiding  fat,  and  also  not  feeding \nveal  or  pork,  neither  of  which  are  good  for  dogs,  beef  and  mutton  are  both \ngood — we  eat  meat  every  day,  and  why  not  our  dogs.  Never  feed  lights,  not \ndigestible,  and  you  might  as  well  feed  leather.  Cooked  liver  is  always  rel- \nished by  a  clog,  and  once  a  week  of  cooked  liver  is  a  treat,  it  also  acting  as \na  laxative,  but  not  much  nourishment  in  liver  and.  a  dog  fed  too  much  liver \nwould  not  thrive,  gain  much  flesh,  or  keep  in  good  condition.  Now  as  to \nmilk — I  don't  go  much  on  too  much  sweet  milk,  don't  think  it  is  good  for  a \ndog,  and  if  given  milk  daily,  would  soon  get  very  tired  of  it.  Sour  milk \nonce  in  a  while,  is  better.  Buttermilk  is  better  yet,  and  in  summer  time \nI  give  my  dogs  all  around,  some  buttermilk  as  an  \"extra.'  once  a  week.  As \nto  feeding,  I  am  writing  now  as  to  the  older,  or  matured  dogs,  and  not  as \nto  the  puppies,  as  to  their  feeding  being  advised   upon   elsewhere. \n\nI  have  on  an  average  of  seventy-five  dogs  in  my  kennel,  and  here  is \ntheir  bill  of  fare.  For  breakfast,  winch  is  served  about  seven  o'clock  in \nsummer  and  eight  o'clock  in  winter,  they  get  Spratt's  Patent  Dog  Cakes  for \ntheir  breakfast,  fed  dry.  but  broken  up  into  small  pieces  (excepting  to  young \npuppies  that  yet  require  soft  food  and  to  be  fed  oftener  than  twice  a  day). \nThis  I  break  up  with  a  hammer  on  the  board  wal",

Boil  the  heads  in  a \nkettle  until  they  are  thoroughly  cooked,  and  the  meat  can  easily  be  scraped \nfrom  the  bones.  This  meat  should  then  be  chopped  or  shredded  into  small \npieces  and  mixed  with  from  three  to  six  times  its  weight  of  whole  wheat \nflour,  rye  or  corn  meal,  softened  and  worked  up  with  soup  liquor.

When  it  is  to  be  fed,  break  it  up  into  pieces,  and  feed  dry  or  soften  it \nwith  meat  or  vegetable  soup.  This  food  can  also  be  improved  by  adding \nvegetables,  such  as  carrots,  turnips,  beets,  onions  or  cabbage,  in  the  propor- \ntion of  one  pound  of  vegetables  to  from  five  to  ten  pounds  of  meat  and \ngrain. \n\n\"The  sportsman  owning  only  one  or  two  dogs,  who  will  condition  his \ndogs  on  food  prepared  in  this  way,  and  who  will  carry  with  him  a  suffi- \ncient quantity  to  provide  for  his  dogs  while  on  a  hunting  trip,  will  be  amply \nrepaid  by  their  superior  condition,  and  he  will  never  go  back  to  the  make- \nshift diet  of  table  scraps  that  is  too  often  resorted  to. \n\n\"Dog  biscuits  simplify  the  feeding  problem  and  the  professional  trainer \nor.  sportsman  who  uses  them  as  a  staple  diet  can  go  on  an  extended  hunt",

Rabies \nis  a  rare  disease,  rarer  today  than  in  the  past,  and  hydrophobia  is  more \nor  less  a  form  of  hysteria.  Were  there  less  talk  about  it,  it  would  be  bet- \nter for  the  community.  A  little  more  knowledge  of  our  own  nervous  sys- \ntem, a  little  less  ignorance  of  the  dog's,  and  we  shall  be  far  more  likely \nto  escape  hydrophob  a  entirely  than  to  die  from  it  or  to  be  saved  by  inocu- \nlation. \n\nI  will  now  give  a  most  important  and  valuable  interview  with  the \nfamous  medical  expert,  Prof.  Edward  C.

The  animal,  be- \ning unable  to  stand,  lies  extended  upon  its  side;  the  respiration  becomes \nmore  and  more  difficult;  there  are  spasmodic  contractions  of  certain  groups \nof  muscles,  complete  prostration,  and  death. \n\n\"The  ordinary  course  of  the  disease  is  four  or  five  days;  it  may  be \nas  short  as  two  or  as  long  as  ten  days. \n\nDumb  Rabies. \n\n\"When  this  form  of  the  disease  is  typical,  it  comes  on  with  restless- \nness, depression,  a  tendency  to  lick  objects,  and.  paralysis  of  the  muscles, \nwhich  close  the  jaws.  As  a  consequence  of  the  paralysis,  the  lower  jaw \ndrops,  the  animal  is  unable  to  close  the  mouth,  the  tongue  hangs  out,  and \nan  abundance  of  saliva  escapes.

Mr.    Greene    said: \n\n\"Much  has  been  written  lately  in  the  press  regarding  the  great  dan- \nger from  the  prevalence  of  'hydrophobia'  in  New  York  city  and  elsewhere, \nand  much  more  of  the  same  terror  will  doubtless  be  written  before  the \nseason  is  far  advanced.  Will  you  allow  me  a  brief  space  for  a  few  ideas \non  this  subject? \n\n\"In  the  first  place,  if  there  be  any  one  point  absolutely  certain  and \nestablished,  it  is  that  the  danger  of  getting  the  above  disease  has  been \ngreatly  exaggerted,  and  that  the  great  majority  of  alleged  cases,  of  not \nonly  'hydrophobia'  in  man,  but  also  'rabies'  in  the  dog,  have  been  cases  of \nsome  other  disease.  It  is  also  easy  to  see  whence  comes  the  influence \ncausing  this  dread  and  delusion.  The  year  following  the  opening  of  the \nfirst  'Pasteur  Institute'  in  Paris,  in  1885,  the  number  of  'hydrophobia'  pa- \ntients treated  in  that  city  leaped  to  three  thousand;  previous  to  that,  Paris \ncould  boast  of  only  about  thirty  'cases'  a  year!  True  'hydrophobia'  is  a \ndisease  so  rare  that  it  is  not  considered  worth  mentioning  in  mortality  re- \nports. Well  known  medical  investigators  who  have  been  searching  for \nmany  years  for  authentic  cases  have  failed  to  find  one.  Such  are  Dr. \nLutaud,  of  Paris;  Dr.  Bell-Taylor,  of  England;  Dr.  Charles  W.  Dulles,  of \nPhiladelphia;  Dr.  E.  C.  Spitzke,  of  New  Yo",

With  only  one  dog  for  a  walk  no  danger  need \never  befall  him  if  you  are  watching  out  for  him  as  you  should  do. \n\nIf  your  dog  gets  into  the  bad  habit  of  running  and  barking  at  a  horse, \nbicycle  or  a  person,  break  him  of  this  at  once  by  calling  him  to  you  there \nand  then;  scold  him  and  switch  him  sharply  over  his  back — any  dog  can \nsoon  be  broken  of  this  by  proper  punishment  at  the  time,  or  of  any  fault \nif  he  is  punished  and  knows  what  it  is  for.  Whipping  a  dog  after  the \nfault  does  no  good  and  is  only  an  unnecessary  infliction.  Whipping  is  not \nnecessarily  cruelty  any  more  than  it  would  be  to  punish  your  child  when \nit  needed  it,  and  children  need  it  oftener  than  dogs  do.  Get  a  rawhide,  keep \nit  handy,  and  when  your  dog  needs  it  give  him  a  few  sharp  cuts  across  the \nrump  or  back,  which  will  smart  and  sting,  and  he'll  remember  it.  Never \nstrike  him  over  the  head  or  kick  him,  which  is  brutal.  Don't  get  angry \nyourself,  keep  cool,  for  the  dog  can  notice  this  the  same  as  your  child  could, \nand  the  punishment  loses  its  effect.  Your  dog  loves  you  fr",
