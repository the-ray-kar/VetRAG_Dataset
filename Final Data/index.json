It's generally advised to wait until at least eighteen months for larger breeds.\n*   Breeding a bitch at every period is not recommended unless she is exceptionally vigorous; allowing service every other period is preferable.\n*   Signs of a bitch being in season include bleeding, with readiness for the dog typically between the tenth and twelfth day from the start of bleeding.\n*   Gestation lasts approximately 63 or 64 days, with variations possible, but veterinary assistance may be needed for significant deviations.\n*   Spring is considered the best time for mating, allowing puppies to grow strong during the summer.\n*   Regulated exercise is crucial both at mating and throughout pregnancy, adjusted to the individual bitch's needs.\n*   A bitch should be in good condition before oestrum to produce a healthy litter, with attention to diet and health three months prior if needed.\n*   A mild cathartic may be beneficial before whelping to ensure proper bowel condition.\n*   One service is usually sufficient when the bitch is ready, but a second service after 24 hours can provide assurance.\n*   After mating, the bitch needs careful attention, including seclusion and regulated exercise.\n*   Diet should be adjusted as the bitch becomes heavy with pups, increasing the amount and providing beef, mutton, bread, milk and soups.\n*   Loss of appetite after giving birth can be addressed with assafetida to restore appetite and milk flow.\n*   Provide a secluded and prepared stall or kennel a week before the due date, ensuring warmth, light, and ventilation.\n*   Secure an old carpet or blanket to the floor of the stall to provide puppies with a foothold.\n*   Protect pups from being laid on by fastening a shelf a few inches from the floor to the sides and back of the box.\n*   Minimize disturbance during whelping, but be prepared to provide assistance or veterinary care if complications arise.\n*   Avoid unnecessary force if manual assistance is required, and consider Fellows' Compound Syrup of Hypophosphate to aid labor pains if needed.\n*   Dangers are greater when a bitch is bred to a much larger dog or in finely bred, pampered bitches.\n*   Consult a veterinary surgeon for wrong presentations or disproportionate pup size.\n*   Ensure adequate milk supply; if inadequate, use a foster mother or artificial food like Spratt's Orphan Puppy Food.\n*   Weaning should commence at six to seven weeks, gradually separating the bitch and feeding pups goat's or cow's milk, boiled with water, and bread. Condensed milk is preferred.\n*   After weaning, supplement with oatmeal, wheat middlings, cornmeal, and lime water for bone formation.\n*   Address bone weakness with precipitated phosphate of lime for the mother.\n*   Gastro-enteritis in puppies should be treated with castor or sweet oil and opiates.\n*   Dr. A.J. Sewell's advice includes using parturition forceps or a crochet for difficult deliveries, avoiding hot baths, and considering an ice bag or a drive to stimulate labor.\n*   Prolapsus or inversion of the womb requires veterinary attention, and amputation may be necessary in severe cases.\n*   Post-whelping care involves providing fresh bedding, warm milk, and easily digestible foods like oatmeal gruel.\n*   Ensure the bitch goes out to relieve herself to prevent complications.\n*   Address issues like excessive discharge with astringent injections or mammary gland problems with hot water fomentations and camphorated oil.\n*   Parturient eclampsia can be managed with bromide of potassium or hydrated chloral.\n*   Maintain cleanliness in puppy quarters to minimize flies.\n*   Protect the bench on all sides and keep it at the right size, preventing puppies from getting cold before drying.",

Early intervention is crucial.\n*   **Onion Remedy:** A home remedy involves placing sliced raw onions in a stocking around the dog's neck to promote watery discharge.\n*   **Diet During Distemper:** Avoid solid meats and foods that raise temperature. Feed gruels, broths, and beef tea. Rice pudding is also a good option.\n*   **Importance of Encouraging Eating:** Coax the dog to eat by offering new and tempting foods like quail or gravy from stewed chicken giblets.\n*   **After-effects:** Be cautious of after-effects like chorea. Eberhart's Tonic Pills can help rebuild the dog's strength.\n*   **Veterinarian's Perspective (Dent):** Distemper is compared to measles, not typhoid. It spreads easily in kennels due to weakened immune systems. Germ theory is emphasized.\n*   **Transmission:** Distemper spreads through air, clothing, contaminated kennels, and dog shows. It is not transmissible to humans but can affect other animals like cats and wolves.\n*   **Symptoms:** Symptoms include catarrhal discharge, intestinal issues, and nervous system involvement (e.g., epileptic spasms). A typical attack begins with listlessness, loss of appetite, and fever.\n*   **Complications:** Pneumonia and epileptic fits are common complications.\n*   **Treatment:** Warm quarters, good nursing, and judicious medical treatment are key. Hyposulphite of soda and quinine can be beneficial. Avoid exhausting medicines.\n*   **A.J. Sewell's Advice:** Isolate infected dogs early and prevent contact with young puppies. Shows are a major source of spread.\n*   **",
