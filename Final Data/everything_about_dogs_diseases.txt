Asthma. — This  is  a  common  disease  and  a  most  distressing  complaint, 
its  victims  being  mostly  found  among  house  pets  and  toy  dogs  that  have 
been  overfed  with  a  too  rich  diet,  and  lack  of  exercise  as  well.  Almast  every 
toy  dog  so  improperly  cared  for  and  fed  will  develop  asthma  as  they  get 
along  in  years.  The  grossness  of  body  induces  and  fosters  it  and  often 
causes  as  well  a  kind  of  scurvy  mange,  the  coat  feeling  harsh  and  dry  with 
a  rough  and  dirty  look.  The  symptoms  are  distressing  paroxysms  of  cough- 
ing with  great  difficulty  in  breathing,  which  occur  frequently.  The  symp- 
toms exhibited  are  due  to 'thickening  of  the  mucus  lining  of  the  trachea  and 
bronchial  tubes  which  by  lessening  the  calibre  of  the  respiratory  tract  in- 
terferes with  the  act  of  breathing  which  is  attended  by  a  loud,  wheezing 
noise.  The  blood  is  imperfectly  aereated  and  the  visible  mucous  mem- 
branes congested  and  dark  in  color.  Pugs  and  aged  Spaniels  seem  pre- 
disposed to  asthmatic  troubles,  which,  while  not  usually  fatal,  do  not 
prove  amenable  to  treatment. 

An  important  feature  of  the  treatment  is  attention  to  the  diet,  which 
should  be  of  a  non-stimulating  character.  First  relieve  the  animal  by  giving 
the  following  antispasmotic  drops:  Compound  spirits  of  sulphuric  ether  and 
tincture  of  opium,  equal  parts,  which  keep  in  a  cool  place  and  well  corked. 


 

The  dose  for  a  15-lb.  to  30-lb.  dog  would  be  a  small  teaspoonful  in  a  couple 
of  tablespoonfuls  of  gruel  o'r  milk.  This,  however,  only  relieves  and  does 
not  cure.  The  dog  must  now  have  frequent  doses  of  a  brisk  aperient,  and 
a  pill  of  the  following  prescription  will  be  found  very  beneficial  given  every 
night  for  a  while: 

Podophyllin    6    grains 

Compound  extract  of  colocynth 30  grains 

Powdered  rhubarb    4  8  grains 

Extract  of  henbane 36  grains 

Mix  and  divide  into  twenty-four  pills. 

Small  breeds  such  as  Pugs  or  Toy  Poodles  give  half  of  one  of  these 
pills. 

A  little  warm  broth  after  the  pill  will  assist  its  action.  Feed  rather 
oftener  than  you  do  your  well  dogs  but  in  small  quantities.  Make  dog  take 
more  exercise  every  day,  which  will  cause  him  to  more  readily  eat  coarser 
food.  The  chance  of  a  complete  cure  is  not  encouraging  in  a  confirmed  or 
chronic  case,  but  the  regular  use  of  the  following  pills  will  have  a  won- 
derful effect  in  counteracting  severe  paroxysms: 

Powdered   ipecacuanha    6   grains 

Powdered   opium    6   grains 

Compound  squill  pill 24   grains 

Powdered  gum  ammoniacum    24  grains 

Powdered   licorice    24   grains 

Powdered  rhubarb 12   grains 

Mix  and  make  into  twenty-four  pills. 

The  dose  for  a  15-lb.  to  40-lb.  dog,  one  pill  morning  and  night.  Small- 
er than  15-lbs.  half  a  pill. 

Whenever,  severe  fits  of  coughing  with  difficulty  of  breathing  occur, 
if  the  antispasmodic  drops  mentioned  in  first  article  are  not  handy,  chloro- 
dine  may  be  given  in  the  same  way  as  the  drops,  the  dose  being  from 
twenty  to  thirty  drops.  Much  relief  can  be  given  to  asthmatical  dogs  by 
confining  them  in  a  close  box  or  kennel  and  filling  it  with  the  smoke  of 
thorn  apple.  This  may  be  done  twice  a  day,  but  care  should  be  taken 
with  such  patients  that  they  are  not  exposed  to  any  sudden  change  of  tem- 
perature, whether  from  heat  or  cold,  or  the  reverse. 

Or,  in  place  of  this  during  acute  attacks  when  the  breathing  is  very 
labored,  relief  may  be  obtained  by  inhalations  of  the  fumes  of  burning 
tar,  resin  or  creosote. 

An  asthmatic  form  of  breathing  is  frequently  found  in  connection  with 
tumors  involving  the  respiratory  tract.  Such  cases  are  incurable  and  it  is 
the  most  merciful  procedure  to  put  the  animal  to  a  painless  death. 

Harry  W.  Lacy  has  the  following  to  say  as  to  asthma,  and  I  append  it 
also  for  the  benfit  it  may  do: 


 

"Asthma  is  a  very  common  ailment  among  sporting  dogs,  and  is 
brought  on  by  repeated  exposure,  followed  by"  inattention.  If  the  simple 
duty  of  making  a  dog  comfortable  be  attended  to  at  the  close  of  each  day's 
work,  there  need  be  little  fear  of  anything  like  this  ensuing.  It  is  not 
actually  the  exposure  to  the  weather  that  causes  a  dog  to  have  lung  trou- 
ble, because  when  a  dog  is  out  exposed  he  is  constantly  on  the  move,  and 
the  circulation  keeps  up,  so  that  it  is  not  possible  for  him  to  contract  a 
chill;  but  the  chill  is  contracted  when  the  animal  returns  home  and  lies 
down  in  a  wet  condition.  Then  the  blood  ceases  to  circulate  as  rapidly 
as  during  exercise,  and  the  animal  becomes  shivery  and  a  cold  develops. 
This  repeated  a  few  times  more  or  less  will  end  in  a  cough,  and  asthma 
will  ensue. 

When  once  a  dog  has  suffered  from  an  attack  of  asthma  there  always 
remains  with  him  a  predisposition  to  a  renewal  of  the  trouble.  It  is  a  most 
distressing  complaint,  and  in  the  case  of  an  animal  like  the  dog,  which  leads, 
or  should  lead  an  active  outdoor  life,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  effect  a 
permanent  cure.  Asthma  differs  from  bronchitis  in  several  ways.  It  comes 
on  in  paroxysms,  which  gradually  get  worse  and  worse,  until  finally  the 
animal  is  suffocated.  The  treatment  usually  adopted  consists  in  placing  the 
animal  in  a  room  or  chamber  where  a  kettle  is  constantly  boiling,  so  that 
the  atmosphere  is  kept  continually  moist — as  moist  warmth  does  as  much 
good  as  anything  to  give  relief  in  such  cases.  As  regards  medicine,  some 
of  the  ordinary  cough  remedies  may  be  tried,  the  best  thing  perhaps  being 
mixtifre  of  oxymel  or  squill  and  glycerine,  in  equal  parts,  to  which  a  large 
paregoric  elixir  is  added.  The  dog  should  have  this  about  three  times  a 
day." 

Another  very  good  thing  to  do  in  connection  with  any  treatment  you  use 
is,  cut  up  an  onion  small  and  fine,  anoint  with  a  drop  or  two  (no  more  or 
it  will  blister)    of  kerosene  is  excellent  for  asthma  and  bronchitis. 

This,  then  put  into  a  cotton  cloth  and  tied  around  the  dog's  neck  will 
afford  relief  in  breathing.     The  onion  should  be  renewed  by  a  fresh  one. 

House  dogs  suffer  greatly  from  over-indulgence,  errors  in  diet  and  lack 
of  exercise,  which  causes  them  to  put  on  flesh  rapidly.  These  conditions 
produce  derangements  of  the  heart,  lungs  and  circulatory  system  that  fre- 
quently result  in  a  morbid  condition  of  the  system,  known  as  asthma.  In- 
flammation of  the  mucous  membrane  lining  of  the  bronchial  tubes  also 
produces  this  disease,  so  that  colds  and  inhalations  of  noxious  gases  and 
vapors  are  common  causes. 

The  disease  is  easily  recognized  and  there  is  no  danger  of  confounding 
it  with  other  affections  of  the  chest.  It  is  not  liable  to  prove  fatal,  but 
seriously  affects  a  dog's  usefulness  and  will  unquestionably  shorten  the 
animal's  life. 

Symptoms:  The  patient  shows  great  distress  and  difficulty  in  breathing, 
particularly  after  slight  exertion,  and  suffers  more  or  less  from  suffocation. 
Respirations  are  not  increased  in  number,  but  are  labored  and  jerky  and 
have  a  wheezy,  croupy  sound  during  expiration.  There  is  generally  a 
peculiar  cough.  The  nostrils  are  dilated  and  the  expression  is  anxious  and 
pitiful.      The   coat   of   over-fed   dogs   suffering   from   asthma   is   rough    and 


 

dirty  and  dry  and  harsh  to  the  touch.     The  skin   is  often  covered  with  a 
mangy-looking   scurf. 

Treatment:  A  radical  cure  of  this  disease  is  seldom  effected,  but  much 
can  be  done  to  improve  the  animal's  condition.  During  an  acute  attack 
of  the  disease  prompt  relief  will  be  afforded  by  giving  an  emetic  of  ten 
to  twenty  grains  of  sulphate  of  zinc,  or  thirty  grains  of  ipecac.  The 
bowels  should  be  kept  open  with  cascara  sagrada  or  olive  oil. 

Much  relief  can  be  afforded  to  dogs  suffering  from  the  spasmodic 
form  of  the  disease  by  confining  them  in  a  small  rocm  and  burning  on  a 
pan  of  coals  one  ounce  of  stramonium  leaves  and  a  drachm  of  nitrate  of 
potassa. 

The  following  prescription  can  then  be  used  with  good  results:  Potassa, 
iodidi  two  drams,  spirits  ammonia  arom.  one  ounce,  tincture  quassiae  and 
aquae,  of  each,  two  ounces.     Dose,  one  teaspoonful  three  times  a  day. 

Give  the  patient  slow  walking  exercise,  restrict  the  diet,  prevent  the 
accumulation  of  flesh  as  much  as  possible  and  aim  to  secure  the  best  physi- 
cal  condition   possible. 

Apoplexy — See    Fits. 

Abscess. — Pus  or  matter  forming  in  or  among  the  tissues  is  abscess. 
It  may  be  due  to  a  blow,  an  accident,  or  caused  by  locil  or  general  in- 
flammation. A  bitch  may,  after  whelping,  have  one  of  the  teats  dammed 
up,  which  gives  rise  to  lacol  inflammation,  which  would  end  in  abscess. 
There  is  unusual  heat  of  the  parts  while  the  abscess  is  forming;  a  hard 
lump  at  first,  but  as  the  matter  forms  this  becomes  softer,  and  is  movable 
under  pressure  of  the  hand.  Should  it  form  very  slowly,  hasten  its  forma- 
tion by  hot  fomentations,  which  must  be  used  continually  for  some  time, 
and  afterwards  cover  the  parts  to  prevent  reaction  from  cold  air.  If  you 
can  keep  a  poultice  on  the  part  this  is  very  useful.  Get  from  your  druggist 
a  piece  of  spongia  piline,  satuate  it  with  warm  water  and  apply  with  the 
waterproof  side  out.  When  the  under  part  of  the  abscess  is  soft  and  moves 
readily  under  pressure,  it  is  ready  for  opening.  To  open  it  take  the  lancet 
between  finger  and  thumb  and  plunge  it  well  into  the  center,  making  a 
clean  downward  cut  to  insure  good  drainage;  press  out  the  matter,  bathe 
with  warm  water  and  keep  it  clean,  which,  in  most  cases,  will  be  kept  so 
by  the  dog's  tongue  if  on  part  of  body  where  he  can  reach  it.  If  not,  then 
apply  Peroxyde  of  Hydrogen  three  or  four  times  a  day. 

In  cases  where  the  abscess  is  deep-seated,  the  veterinary  surgeon  alone 
should  use  the  knife.  A  light  and  nutritious  diet  should  be  given,  and  in 
many  cases  no  medicine  is  required,,  but  a  mild  purge  can  be  given  when 
it  is  forming.  Should  dog  be  much  reduced  and  his  appetite  impaired  after 
an  abscess  a  short  treatment-of  Sergeant's  or  Clayton's  Condition  Pills  will 
do  al  ot  of  good.  Abscesses  forming  :"n  lung  disease  would  discharge  the 
matter  through  the  nose,  also  be  coughed  up,  while  in  the  uterus  it  would 
be  by  the  vagina.  Other  internal  organs  may  be  the  seat  of  abscesses,  but 
none  of  these  cases  can  be  treated  by  the  amateur,  but  should  be  intrusted 
to  the  veterinary  surgeon. 


 

PERI-RECTAL  ABSCESS. 

In  a  large  number  of  cases — in  fact  nearly  every  one — of  distemper, 
rectal  abscesses  will  be  found.  To  those  who  do  not  clearly  understand  the 
best  method  of  handling  them,  we  make  the"  following  suggestions: 

Take  the  dog  carefully  between  the  knees  and  bend  the  tail  sharply 
upward.  This  will  cause  the  rectum  to  project.  With  the  thumb  and  finger 
press  firmly  upon  the  projection,  as  if  to  extract  the  milk  from  a  cow's 
teat.  Use  considefable  force.  If  there  is  an  abscess,  this  will  break  it  and 
press  out  the  pus.  Be  careful  that  the  pus  does  not  fly  into  the  eyes. 
Repeat  this  operation  every  day  so  long  as  there  is  pus.  You  will  find 
this  is  a  material  aid  in  effecting  a  cure. 

Abortion. — Strictly  speaking,  abortion  means  the  expulsion  of  the 
foetus  before  it  is  sufficiently  matured  for  independent  life,  but  applied  to 
the  lower  animals  it  is  generally  used  to  mean  premature  parturition  as 
well.  Abortion  is  comparatively  rare  in  dogs,  but  premature  whelping, 
especially  just  a  week  or  so  before  the  pups  are  due,  is  by  no  means  un- 
common. The  causes  of  abortion  and  premature  parturition  are  various.  A 
low  diet,  causing  extreme  paverty  when  the  system  requires  extra  support 
for  the  growth  of  the  unborn  pups,  and  the  secretion  of  milk  for  them 
afterwards,  is  likely  to  cause  it;  and,  on  the  other  hand,  a  plethoric  state 
of  the  body  from  over-feeding  and  want  of  exercise  is  also  a  likely  cause, 
and  very  severe  exercise,  jumping  from  a  height  or  over  fences,  and,  what 
is  too  common,  blows  or  kicks  on  the  abdomen.  It  may  also  be  brought 
on  by  drinking  foul  water,  eating  putrid  food  or  anything  likely  to  cause 
inflammation  of  the  bowels,  violent  diarrhea,  and  consequent  straining. 
Young  bitches  bred  from  before  the  system  is  matured,  and  old  worn-out 
ones,  are  most  likely  to  abort.  Preventive  measures  consist  in  general 
attention  to  health,  both  in  regard  to  the  food  and  water  given  and  the 
sanitary  condition  of  the  kennel,  and  the  permitting  of  regular,  but  not 
violent,  exercise,  and  in  selecting  only  for  breeding  purposes  bitches  that 
are  matured  and  in  vigorous  health.  When  a  bitch  has  had  her  pups 
before  the  full  time  she  should  not  be  again  bred  from  until  at  least  one 
period  of  oestrum  has  passed. 

Anaemia  (Poverty  of  Blood)  is  shown  by  paleness  of  the  mucous 
membranes,  weak  and  slow  pulse  and  heart-beat,  lack  of  energy,  depression 
and  lassitude.  As  the  disease  progresses,  the  eye  sinks,  becoming  dull,  the 
gait  is  staggering,  the  breathing  becomes  labored  and  wheezy,  and  the  dog 
gradually  sinks. 

The  causes  are  poor  food,  exhaustive  demands  on  stud  dogs,  excessive 
secretion  of  milk,  and  allowing  bitches  to  suckle  puppies  too  long.  Anaemia 
may  also  be  the  result  of  some  other  disease  impoverishing  the  system, 
and  it  is  not  infrequently  a  consequence  of  the  dog  harboring  worms.  Give 
in  small  quantities  and  frequently  the  most  nourishing  foods — milk,  flesh, 
broths,  etc. — pepsin  porci  to  assist  digestion,  and  wine  of  iron  or  syrup  of 
phosphates  as  a  tonic.  Sergeant's  Clayton's,  or  Eberhart's  condition  pills 
are  a  good  tonic.  At  the  same  time  see  that  the  dog  is  warmly  housed 
and  that  he  gets  plenty  of  sunlight  and  fresh  air. 


 

Asphyxia. — Inability  to  breathe  as  the  result  of  nearly  drowning.  In 
treating  never  attempt  to  make  dog  swallow  while  in  an  unconscious  state; 
inject  stimulants  under  the  skin,  such  as  from  ten  'to  twenty  drops  of 
brandy.  Dash  hot  and  cold  water  over  the  head  alternately  and  make  the 
attempt  of  artificial  respiration  as  follows,  when  due  to  partial  drowning: 
Hold  the  dog  up  with  his  head  downward  for  a  minute,  so  as  to  allow  the 
water  to  run  out  of  his  lungs,  then  place  the  dog  on  his  back,  draw  the 
tongue  out,  and  with  the  hand  placed  on  the  lower  part  of  the  chest  where 
the  latter  meets  the  abdomen,  press  downwards  and  forwards  with  some 
little  force,  then  suddenly  raise  the  hand  to  allow  the  chest  to  expand. 
This  should  be  repeated  every  three  or  four  seconds. 

Bladder,  Inflammation  of  the. — The  symptoms  are  great  pain  on  pres- 
sure over  the  region  of  the  bladder;  the  urine  passed  is  scant  in  quantity 
but  at  frequent  intervals,  and  evidently  with  great  pain.  It  frequently  comes 
from  a  blow  but  is  also  produced  by  long  exposure  to  cold  or  wet,  and  often 
the  result  of  giving  too  much  cantharides  and  turpentine.  Sometimes  due 
to  stricture  of  the  urethra  (urinary  passage)  or  calculi  (stone).  The 
treatment  consists  of  first  giving  a  brisk  purgative,  and  should  this  not  act 
it  should  be  assisted  by  clysters  of  luke-warm  water  or  thin  gruel,  or  a 
hot  bath.  The  acute  symptoms  having  passed,  give  3  gr.  to  5  gr.  of  benzoic 
acid  in  pill  form  three  times  a  day.  If  the  urine  is  not  freely  passed  the 
catheter  should  be  used  in  the  manner  detailed  under  heading  of  Paralysis 
of  the  Bladder.  When  the  bowels  have  been  opened,  give  a  dose  every 
six  hours  of  the  following  "fever  mixture." 

Powdered   nitre    1    dram 

Sweet  spirit  of  nitre 1'2    ounce 

Mindererus    spirit    1  "2    ounce 

Wine    of   antimony    1    dram 

Tincture  of  digitalis    y2    dram 

Water    4   ounces 

Mix.     Dose  for  a  dog,  25-lb.  to   30-lb.  weight,   one  tablespoonful  every 

four  hours  in  a  little  gruel.     Smaller  dogs  not  quite  so  much.     From 
50-lbs.  up  a  tablespoonful  and  a  half  as  a  dose. 
• 

The  patient  will  experience  relief  of  the  parts  are  bathed  continuously 
with  a  warm  infusion  of  poppy-heads,  or  warm  water  alone,  care  being 
taken  that  he  is  not  afterward  exposed  to  cold.  The  clog's  diet  should  be 
light  and  nourishing. 

Bladder,  Paralysis —  of This  affection  is  shown  by  the  constant  efforts 

of  the  dog  to  urinate  and  inability  to  do  so,  the  water  coming  away  in 
dribbles.  It  may  arise  from  stone  in  the  bladder.  A  common  cause  is  over- 
distension of  the  bladder  caused  by  keeping  dogs  where  they  will  not 
urinate.  Some  dogs  will  not  do  so  when  shut  up  in  a  room,  or  when  on 
the  chain;  hence  the  necessity,  too  often  neglected,  of  taking  dogs  off  the 
benches  at  exhibitions  at  regular  intervals.  This  compulsory  retention  of 
urine  produces  spasm  of  the  neck  of  the  bladder,  and  paralysis — loss  of  the 


 

necessary  muscular  power — follows.  It  may  also  be  the  result  of  injury  to 
the  spine,  or  of  debilitating  disease.  The  effect  of  continued  hot  fomen- 
tations should  be  tried,  and  if  these  -fail,  the  urine  should  be  drawn  off  by 
means  of  a  catheter.  Passing  a  catheter  is  a  very  simple  matter.  The 
dog  should  be  placed  upon  his  back,  and  the  prepuce  pressed  back,  so  as  to 
bring  the  penis  into  view;  the  catketer  should  then  be  dressed  with  a  little 
olive  oil  or  vaseline  and  passed  gently  into  the  opening  at  the  point  of  the 
penis.  This  will  introduce  it  into  the  bladder,  when  the  piece  of  wire  with 
which  the  instrument  is  provided  should  be  withdrawn.  Should  the  urine 
not  flow  freely,  the  dog  can  be  stood  upon  its  legs,  keeping  the  catheter 
in  position.  If  a  catheter  is  not  at  hand,  pressure  with  both  hands  through 
the  abdominal  walls  in  the  region  of  the  bladder,  will  empty  it  of  its  con- 
tents. If  paralysis  of  the  hind  legs  is  present,  an  assistant  should  raise 
the  body  from  the  ground,  by  means  of  the  tail,  whilst  the  operator  is  press- 
ing the  sides. 

During  convalescence  give  barley-water  to  drink,  and  soft  nourishing 
food — porridge  and  milk,  broth  and  bread,  etc. 

The  following  on  this  subject,  is  valuable:  This  disease  occurs  some- 
times from  keeping  dogs  of  very  clean  habits  shut  up,  with  no  opportunity 
to  relieve  themselves.  The  bladder  becomes  overdistended,  paralyzing  the 
parts.  It  may  also  be  the  result  of  a  general  paralysis  following  an  injury 
to  the  spine,  the  brain  or  some  part  of  the  nervous  system.  The  dog  at  first 
is  unable  to  pass  water  and  later  it  dribbles  from  him.  The  first  thing 
to  do  is  to  relieve  the  bladder.  If  there  is  no  mechanical  obstruction  this 
can  be  done  by  pressure  over  the  walls  of  the  abdomen.  If  this  fails,  a 
catheter  must  be  passed;  in  fact,  it  is  the  safest  thing  to  do,  for  when  an 
attempt  is  made  to  empty  he  bladder  by  applying  force  from  the  outsir.e 
there  is  danger  of  rupturing  the  parts.  The  catheter  for  a  small  dog 
should  be  No.  00,  for  terriers  No.  1,  for  setters  and  pointers  No.  2.  In 
the  event  of  a  small  gravel  lodging  in  the  passage,  it  is  usually  removed 
by  carefully  passing  a  small  grooved  silver  probe.  To  tone  up  the  bladder, 
nux  vomica  is  the  mast  useful  drug.  The  dose  is  from  one  to  seven  drops 
of  the  tincture  three  times  a  day  in  a  teaspoonful  of  water  given  "after  feed- 
ing. 

Bleeding  From  the  Stomach The  vomiting  of  blood  is  not  of  ordinary 

occurrence  and  may  be  the  result  of  many  causes.  If  due  to  a  recent. in- 
jury or  breaking  down  of  the  tissues,  it  will  be  bright  red  in  color,  if  the 
blood  is  coming  from  the  vens  it  will  be  of  darker  hue,  and  if  it  has  re- 
mained in  the  stomach  some  time  it  will  be  of  coffee  color.  In  treating  give 
the  stomach  at  least  twenty-four  hours'  rest  or  feed  only  milk  and  water, 
and  every  three  hours  give  from  a  teaspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  of  the

BOILS — 

These  are  similar  to  the  boils  in  human  beings  and  are  due  to  the 
same  causes,  that  is,  they  indicate  either  a  poverty  of  the  system  and  a  gen- 
eral weakness,  or  they  may  be  the  result  of  plethora  and  too  much  blood. 


 

They  also  follow  diseases  like  distemper  and  are  not  uncommonly  induced 
by  worms.  Boils  are  very  painful  and  make  the  dog  cross.  They  appear, 
usually,  where  the  skin  is  thinnest.  Their  first  appearance  is  in  the  form 
of  small  red  swellings,  which  enlarge,  become  hot  and  painful  and  even- 
tually break  and  discharge  their  contents.  They  usually  appear  on  the 
inside  of  the  thighs  and  bellies  of  young  puppies  when  suffering  with  dis- 
temper or  worms.  If  accompanying  distemper  they  should  not  be  treated, 
but  at  other  times  the  proper  thing  to  do  is  to  reform  the  diet,  give  more 
green  food,  bathe  oftener,  exercise  more  and  when  the  boils  are  soft  and 
ripe  open  them  with  a  sharp  knife  and  dress  with  an  antiseptic  solution. 

Blood,  Poverty  of  the. — See  Anaemia. 

Bites. — A  great  injustice  is  done  to  a  great  many  dogs  by  the  old  say- 
ing that  "dogs  delight  to  bark  and  bite,"  for  there  are  very  many  that  do 
not  delight  in  either,  but  are  to  the  contrary,  properly  behaved  dogs  in  this 
respect.  Some  clogs  do,  however,  but  generally  in  self  defense,  or  at  sup- 
posed call  of  duty.  Should  your  dog  get  bitten,  wash  the  wound  with  tepid 
water,  press  out  any  blood,  and  pour  a  little  of  friar's  balsam,  or  compound 
tincture  of  myrh  on  it. 

Since  the  above  was  written,  I  was  bitten  on  the  left  hand  in  fourteen 
places,  by  a  Bulldog  I  was  showing  in  the  ring,  at  the  1916  dog  show  at 
Louisville,  Ky.,  State  Fair,  really  the  worst  chewing  up  I  ever  got.  Was 
taken  to  the  hospital  near  the  dog  show.  The  doctor  washed  the  hand, 
then  dressed  it  with  tincture  of  Iodine,  and  then  applied  a  healing  salve 
called  "Unguentine,"  (to  be  had  at  any  drug  store),  repeating  this  daily 
while  show  lasted,  and  I  done  the  same  for  a  week  after  home.  The  hand 
wrapped  with  cotton  and  bandage,  and  the  result  was  my  hand  got  entirely 
well.  I  will  just  mention,  however,  that  the  poor  dog,  after  home,  as  at 
the  show,  where  for  some  cause  he  suddenly  went  off  his  base,  continued 
here  to  be  crazy,  did  not  try  again  to  bite  me  (we  were  friends),  but 
did  bite  every  dog  he  got  at  here,  and  suddenly  died  three  days  later, 
being  buried  by  me  in  my  back  yard,  under  an  apple  tree — and  I  miss 
poor  "Wrinks."  I  find  that  many  doctors  now  use  tincture  of  Iodine, 
the  first  thing,  on  a  bite  or  wound,  in  place  of  cauterizing,  and  I  strongly 
advise  doing  so,  and  then  the  salve.  The  first  thing  to  do  if  you  are 
bitten,  is  to  suck  the  bite,  if  on  any  part  of  your  body  you  can  get  at  with 
your  mouth,  and  spit  this  out,  which  abstracts  any  poison — if  any  poison, 
from  the  bite.  Don't  be  afraid  of  a  dog's  bite,  don't  get  scared,  the  only 
danger  is,  a  small  percentage  of  blood  poison  setting  in,  but  if  your  own 
blood  is  in  good  condition  there  is  no  danger.  "Wrinks"  case,  with  almost 
every  veterinarian,  would  have  been  a  sure  case  of  rabies,  but  as  I  don't 
believe  in  this,  I  am  yet  here  writing  this  article. 

Instead  of  cauterizing  a  bite,  which  always  makes  a  nasty  looking 
wound,  I  much  prefer  to  use  the  tincture  of  Iodine  (using  a  small  brush), 
or  if  this  is  not  on  hand,  then  apply  Peroxyde  of  Hydrogen,  which  will 
do  all  the  cauterizing  will  do. 

Should  your  dog  be  bitten  by  a  strange  dog  and  any  suspicion  exists  of 
so-called  rabies  in   the  strange   dog,   immediately  use   the   tincture  of  Iron, 


 

or  Peroxyde  of  Hydrogen,  and  isolate  the  dog  until  the  time  has  passed 
for  any  fear  of  hydrophobia  developing.  This  advice  is  given  to  those 
who  believe  in  the  so-termed  hydrophobia,  and  you  are  referred  now  to 
Rabies,  where  I  give  fully  my  own  belief  on  this  subject,  as  well  as  the 
ideas  of  others.  In  case  there  is  a  tear,  it  may  be  necessary  to  bandage 
or  draw  together  with  a  few  stitches  of  silk  thread. 

Bowels,  Inflammation  of  (Enteritis;  Peritonitis). — This  is  so  ably 
treated  by  Dalziel,  and  by  experience  I  know  it  to  be  good,  that  I  here  re- 
produce his  article  in  full.  The  best  plan,  however,  is  to  at  once  send  for 
a  veterinarian,  providing  you  have  one  who  understands  or  has  made  a 
specialty  of  treating  dogs — anyhow,  get  the  best  one  in  your  locality  and 
don't  stop  to  think  of  what  it  will  cost,  for  you  owe  it  to  your  dog  to  help 
him  out  of  his  trouble  if  such  a  thing  is  possible: 

"The  severity  and  very  dangerous  charcter  of  this  disease  in  the  dog 
is  such  that  perhaps  the  very  best  advice  that  can  be  given  to  the  amateur 
who  finds  his  valuable  dog  attacked  by  it  is,  send  for  a  qualified  veterinary 
surgeon  without  delay.  The  owner  may,  however,  he  possessed  of  sufficient 
self-confidence  as  to  wish  to  try  his  own  skill  in  treating  the  disease,  or 
the  animal  may  not  be  considered  of  sufficient  value  to  incure  the  expense 
of  employing  a  professional  man,  although  there  may  be  every  desire  to 
save  the  animal's  life;  and  if  I  can  help  in  any  such  commendable  endeavor 
without  encouraging  useless  and  ignorant  experiments  at  the  cost  of  torture 
to  the  dog,  I  shall  feel  that  I  have  been  of  some  little  service.  Whatever 
course  is  determined  on,  whether  home  treatment  or  the  calling  in  of  pro- 
fessional aid,  the  decision  should  not  be  taken  till  the  symptoms  have  been 
carefully  and  minutely  observed,  and  the  greatest  attention  must  be  paid 
to  them,  else  there  is  every  fear  of  the  amateur  confounding  it  with  and 
treating  it  as  colic,  a  disease  which,  although  strongly  resembling  inflamma- 
tion in  some  of  its  symptoms,  differs  widely  in  others,  and  requires  totally 
different  treatment.  Colic,  if  neglected  or  if  wrongly  treated,  may,  and 
frequently  does,  end  in  inflammation,  but  it  is  in  itself  a  distinct  ailment, 
and  the  same  remark  equally  applies  to  constipation  or  obstruction  of  the 
bowels.  As  inflammation  of  the  bowels  or  enteritis  is  one  of  the  most  fatal 
diseases  to  which  the  dog  is  liable — frequently  carrying  him  off  very  quick- 
ly— no  half  measures  will  do  for  it;  but,  having  ascertained  clearly  from 
the  prevailing  symptoms  that  the  disease  is  actually  present,  remedial  meas- 
ures must  be  adopted  with  promptitude  and  energy.  The  main  causes  of  the 
disease  are  irregular  or  improper  diet,  or  it  may  be  irritation  caused  by  the 
dog  having  swallowed  some  hard  indegestible  substance;  exposure  to  cold 
and  wet  may  produce  it,  and  it  is  sometimes  the  result  of  ill-usage,  such  as 
a  kick. 

"Inflamation  of  the  bowels  may  be  distinguished  from  colic  in  being 
more  gradual  in  its  approach,  and  is  always  ushered  in  by  general  feverish- 
ness;  the  nose  is  hot  and  dry,  the  eyes  red  and  inflamed,  and  the  whole 
countenance  is  expressive  of  great  anxiety;  shivering  fits  occur,  the  belly  is 
hard  and  distended,  and  in  the  surface  hot  to  the  touch;  the  urine  is  gener- 
ally scanty  and  high  colored.  As  in  colic,  when  standing,  the  back  is  arched, 
the  feet  are  drawn  in  toward  each  other,  and  the  tail  is  tightly  tucked  be- 


 

tween  the  legs,  or  the  clog  may  steal  into  a  quiet  corner,  stretch  his  legs 
out  before  and  behind,  and  crouch  with  his  belly  on  the  ground,  probably 
finding  temporary  relief  by  bringing  it  in  contact  with  the  cold  floor  or 
ground;  the  dOg  may,  at  the  same  time,  be  observed  to  frequently  turn  an 
anxious  face  toward  his  flanks. 

"Another  safe  and  pretty  certain  way  of  distinguishing  between  enteri- 
tis and  simple  obstruction  or  colic  is  by  pressing  the  hand  along  the  belly; 
in  the  latter  disease,  especially  colic,  the  rubbing  gives  relief,  whereas  in 
inflammation  it  evidently  causes  acute  pain;   the  cry  of  pain  given  by  the 
dog  in  this  disease  is  shorter  and  sharper  than  the  rather  prolonged  howl 
in  colic,  but  to  distinguish  by  this  symptom  would  require  finer  discrimi- 
nation  than   can   be  reasonably   expected    from   the   comparatively   inexper- 
ienced, for  whom  I  presume  to  write.     I  may  here  mention  the  fact  that 
enteritis  is  very  commonly  a   complication  of  that   'scorge  of   the  kennel/ 
distemper,   and   this   fact  alone   sufficiently   shows   the   folly   of  trusting    to- 
any  single  medicine,  pill,  powder,  potion,  or  any  so-called  specific  whatever 
for  the  cure  of  that  disease.     The  treatment  proper  in   the  disease  under' 
consideration  consists  in  getting  the  bowels  relieved  as  speedily  as  possi- 
ble by  the  mildest  means   that  can  be  used,   constipation   being   generally 
present;  for  this  purpose  the  use  of  clysters  every  fifteen  minutes,  as  recom- 
mended  in   obstruction   of  the  bowels,   should   be  resorted   to,   and   the  in- 
jections must  be  used  gently  and  with  as  little  fuss  and  annoyance  to  the 
patient  as  possible.     When  the  clysters  begin  to  take  effect,  the  evacuation 
of   the  bowels   should   be  assisted   by  a   dose   of   castor   oil.      From   six   to 
twelve  leeches,   according  to  the  size  and   strength   of  the  dog,   should   be 
applied   to   the   belly,   and    after   they   have   filled   themselves   the   bleeding 
from  the  bites  may  be  encouraged  by  bathing  the  whole  surrounding  parts 
freely   and   continuously   with   warm   water.      Many   of-  the   best   writers   on 
dogs  recommend   giving  calomel  and  opium   combined,   and   it  may  appear- 
presumptuous  in  me  to  offer  a  contrary  opinion,  but  experientia  docet.     I 
have  given  calomel  to  dogs  in  this  disease  and  many  others,  but  I  do  not 
think   I   ever   once   gave   it  without   making   the   patient  worse;    so   I   have 
long  discarded  it,  in  the  firm  belief  that  it  is  not  a  medicine  at  all  suited 
to  the  dog,  and  I  am  quite  certain  from  my  own  experience,  and  feel  sure 
the  best  veterinarians  will   bear  me  out,   that  the  abusive   use  of  calomel 
and   other   forms   of  mercury,   given   too   often   in   immense   and   poisonous 
doses  to  the  dog,  by  country-  farriers  and  others  ignorant  of  its  properties, 
and    who    work    by    the    rule    of    thumb,    is    not    infrequently    the    cause    of 
inflammation   of   the  bowels.      Instead  of  calomel,   I  have  in   several   cases 
used  the  following  with  excellent  effect: 

Take  true  James'   Powder 3   grains 

Powdered  Opium 14    grain 

In    one   ppwder.      Give    every    two   hours    till    three   are   given;    large- 
sized  dogs  require  double  that  dose. 

"If  happily  the  dog  gets  over  the  attack,  with  signs  of  returning  health 
great  weakness  will  be  evident,  and  this  must  be  met  by  good  nursing  and 
a  generous,  but  easily  assimilated,   diet.     Beef  tea,  thickened,   with  bread, 


 

rice,  etc.,  will  answer  well.  The  diet  must  be  so  varied  as  to  keep  the 
bowels  open  without  the  use  of  medicine." 

When  well  on  the  road  to  health  great  progress  will  be  accelerated  by 
giving  Eberhart's  Tonic  Pills  for  twenty  to  thirty  days.  They  contain  no 
"dope,"  (unlike  many  others),  make  the  dog  eat,  and  get  him  back  to 
health,  flesh,  and  spirits. 

To  allay  the  pain,  give  5  gr.  to  10  gr.  of  chloral,  with  5  to  30  drops 
of  tincture  of  opium;   also  apply  hot  flannels  to  the  abdomen. 

The  following  treatise  on  this  trouble  was  written  especially  for  this 
book  by  Dent,  and  I  consider  it,  also,  very  valuable: 

"An  affection  of  the  small  intestines.  This  disease  is  of  the  most 
dangerous  character  and  unfortunately  prevalent.  It  will  carry  off  a  dog 
in  a  few  hours,  and  in  its  treatment  there  is  always  danger  of  its  being 
confounded  with  common  colic,  which  is,  as  a  rule,  not  fatal.  The  diseases 
can   be   distinguished   from   each   other   as   follows: 

Colic  comes  on  quickly  and  is  relieved  by  rubbing  the  stomach — the 
pain  is  more  intense  and  spasmodic. 

Enteritis  comes  on  more  slowly  with  greater  general  depression,  the 
pain  is  continuous  and  is  increased  by  rubbing  the  stomach. 

Causes. — The  common  cause  of  inflammation  of  the  small  intestines 
is  the  feeding  of  an  improper  diet,  the  indigestible  substances  setting  up 
an  irritation  that  inflames  the  delicate  lining  of  the  bowels.  Cold,  ex- 
posure, wet,  blows,  kicks,  or  anything  that  will  injure  the  small  intestines. 
The  parts  affected  in  this  disease  are  also  causes.  This  disease  is  also  a 
common  complication  of  distemper. 

Symptoms. — This  disease  is  always  ushered  in  by  feverishness,  the 
eyes  are  red  and  swollen,  nose  hot  and  dry,  mouth  sticky,  the  belly  is  hard, 
tense  and  hot  to  the  touch,  the  patient  has  frequent  shivering  fits,  and  the 
countenance  is  most  expressive  of  pain  and  anxiety.  The  animal  will  steal 
away  into  some  corner  and  stretch  itself  out  on  the  floor  so  as  to  bring 
the  belly  next  to  the  cool  floor  or  ground,  and  in  this  way  may  be  relieved, 
turning  his  head  every  few  moments  and  look  at  its  flanks.  When  stand- 
ing the  tail  is  tucked  between  its  legs,  all  four  feet  are  drawn  in  toward 
each  other,  and  the  back  is  arched. 

Treatment. — Warm  comfortable  quarters  are  of  the  first  importance, 
and  a  thick  woolen  jacket  carefully  padded  and  adjusted  over  the  belly, 
chest  and  flanks  will  protect  the  parts  and  give  relief.  In  all  stages  of 
the  disease  it  is  of  the  utmost  importance  that  the  bowels  be  relieved  of 
their  irritating  contents. 

Give  injections  of  lukewarm  water  and  castile  soap — or  thin  oatmeal 
water  containing  one  ounce  of  glycerine — until  the  lower  bowels  are  emp- 
tied. 

Then  give  a  dose  of  olive  oil  and  castor  oil,  in  equal  parts,  to  which 
can  be  added  from  10  to  20  drops  of  laudanum  for  each  ounce  of  the  oils, 
so  as  to  relieve  the  pain. 

One  ounce  of  this  combination  of  oils  can  be  given  as  a  dose  to  a  40-lb. 
dog.     Smaller  dogs  less  in  proportion  to  size. 


 

"After  the  bowels  have  been  opened  to  further  allay  the  pain  give  to  a 
40-lb.  dog  from  5  to  10  grains  of  chloral  with  from  5  to  30  drops  of  the 
tincture  of  opium,  as  often  as  necessary.  The  diet  and  feeding  must  be 
carefully  looked  to.  The  food  must  be  soft,  semi-liquid,  bland  and  unir- 
ritating,  fed  only  a  small  quantity  at  a  time,  and  three  grains  of  pepsin 
given  after  each  meal. 

"Drink  must  be  allowed  only  in  very  small  quantities.  Milk  with  the 
addition  of  lime  water  is  excellent.  If  there  is  a  tendency  to  vomit  give  the 
subnitrate  of  bismuth  in  5  to  10  grain  doses,  three  times  a  day.  When 
the  dog  begins  to  recover  from  the  disease  the  proportion  of  solid  food 
can  be  increased,  and  a  good  tonic  condition  pill  will  facilitate  convales- 
cence and  build  up  the  patient." 

Eberhart's  tonic  pills,  or  Clayton's,  or  Sergeant's  condition  pills,  would 
new  be  of  great  benefit,  used  for  a  few  weeks. 

Back  Stiffness Usually  the  result  of  old  age,  chronic  rheumatism  or 

lumbago,  but  sometimes  the  result  of  sprains,  a  blow  or  other  injury,  such  as 
bt  ing  run  over  across  the  back.  The  patient  in  most  cases  walks  with 
difficulty  or  may  start  out  all  right  and  in  the  best  of  spirits,  but  before 
going  far  begins  to  lag,  loses  its  spirits  and  drops  its  tail.  In  most  cases 
there  is  pain  evidenced  upon  pressure  being  applied  to  the  back.  In 
other  cases  the  patent  can  walk  very  well,  but  is  unable  to  jump.  Treat- 
ment consists  of  absolute  rest  and  the  use  of  a  good  liniment,  the  follow- 
ing being  recommended:  Tincture  of  hyoscyamus  one-half  ounce,  chloroform 
one-half  ounce,  spirits  of  camphor  one  ounce,  soap  liniment  one  ounce. 
The  parts  should  be  massaged  and  this  liniment  applied  with  gentle  friction 
twice  a  day.  It  is  also  advisable  to  give  a  dose  of  aperient  medicine  and 
tu   feed  on  a  light  diet. 

Bad  Breath.- — This  disgusting  condition  is  due  to  a  variety  of  causes, 
chief  among  them  being  a  disordered  stomach,  the  result  of  worms  or  in- 
digestion, and  a  diseased  condition  of  the  teeth,  which  is  more  or  less 
dependent  upon  the  condition  of  the  stomach.  Diseases  of  the  lungs,  as 
well  as  a  catarrhal  condition  of  the  nasal  passages,  also  affect  the  breath. 
Remove  the  cause;  that  is,  if  the  stomach  is  out  of  order  treat  for  worms 
and  use  a  good  condition  pill  until  the  digestive  processes  are  normal.  If 
the  teeth  are  covered  with  tartar  remove  it  by  scaling  with  a  small  scraper, 
such  as  dentists  use,  and  then  clean  with  an  ordinary  tooth  brush  and 
dental  powder.  If  the  breath  remains  bad  after  the  teeth  have  been  cleaned 
and  the  stomach  toned  up,  give  twice  a  day  for  a  week  two  to  ten  grains  of 
salol.  If  there  is  a  catarrhal  discharge  from  the  nostrils  add  a  teaspoon- 
ful  of  salt  to  a  ten-ounce  bottle  of  water  and  syringe  out  the  nostrils  twice 
a  day  with  the  solution. 

Balanatis. — This  disease  is  not  of  common  occurrence  and  consists 
of  a  purulent  discharge  from  the  prepuce.  In  treating,  the  general  health 
should  be  given  attention  and  the  diet  carefully  regulated.  Cleanliness  of 
surroundings  is  also  important.  Feed  good  dog  cakes,  with  milk,  and  little 
or  no  meat.     Internally  give  Fowler's  solution  of  arsenic  in  doses  of  from 


 

two  to  fifteen  drops  three  times  a  day  after  feeding.  Cleanse  the  parts 
with  tepid  water,  which  should  he  injected  into  the  prepuce  with  a  syringe, 
and  then  syringe  out  the  prepuce  with  a  solution  of  nitrate  of  silver  one 
grain  to  the  ounce  of  water,  or  use  a  saturated  solution  of  boracic  acid. 
In  some  severe  cases  the  base  of  the  penis  is  diseased,  and  it  should  be 
exposed  and  painted  with  a  four  per  cent  solution  of  nitrate  of  silver  twice 
a  week. 

Bruises Where  there  is   much   swelling,   bathe  with   warm   water  for 

an  hour,  dry  well  and  rub  in  the  following: 

Liniment  for  Sprains,  Bruises,  Etc. — Take  equal  parts  of  spirits  of 
turpentine,  liquid  ammonia  (not  the  strongest),  laudanum  and  rape  oil.  Mix 
to  iorm  liniment.  If  skin  is  broken,  touch  the  wound  with  tincture  of  ben- 
zoin and  rub  the  liniment  all  around,  but  not  into  the  broken  skin. 

Burns  and  Scalds. — Mix  equal  parts  of  linseed  oil  and  lime  water  and 
apply  freely  as  soon  as  possible  after  the  accident.  A  severe  burn  or  scald 
is  sure  to  be  a  blemish  for  life,  and  if  severe  often  gives  a  violent  shock 
to  the  system,  and  symptoms  of  illness  arising  from  it  should  be  observed 
and  treated  according  to  circumstances.  Apply  the  above  oil  direct  to 
the  wound  alone,  and  at  once  cover  thickly  with  cotton  wool  to  exclude 
the  air  from  the  bladders  formed.  On  removing  the  dressing  prick  the 
bladders  with  a  needle,  smooth  them  down  gently,  re-apply  the  dressing, 
taking  care  that  no  hairs  are  left  on  the  sore  places. 

Burns. — May  be  due  to  contact  with  fire,  but  more  frequently  it  is 
boiling  water  that  has  caused  the  injury.  In  some  cases  the  skin  is 
scorched  and  the  hair  frizzled,  but  the  hair  roots  are  not  destroyed  and  a 
new  growth  soon  reappears.  In  other  cases  the  tissues  of  the  skin  are 
destroyed,  the  hair  roots  killed  and  a  large  blister  forms,  which,  usually, 
goes  through  a  stage  of  suppuration  and  then  heals,  leaving  a  smooth, 
white,  glistening  scar  on  which  the  hair  never  grows.  If  the  skin  is  only 
scorched  apply  three  or  four  times  a  day  the  common  lime  water  and  linseed 
oil  lotion,  composed  of  one  part  of  lime  water  to  two  parts  of  linseed  oil. 
This  relieves  the  pain,  protects  the  parts  from  the  air  and  in  a  few  days 
the  patient  is  all  right.  In  those  cases  where  the  skin  has  been  burned 
deeply  the  parts  should  be  coated  with  boracic  ointment.  After  the 
blister  breaks  there  is  nothing  better  than  boracic  ointment  to  apply  to 
the  raw  surfaces.  It  should  be  laid  on  thickly  and  protected  by  lint  or 
absorbent  cotton,  kept  in  place  by  a  bandage.  The  dressing  should  be 
repeated  three  times  a  day. 

Baldness — Smooth-coated  toy  dogs  are  often  seen  with  hardly  any 
coat.  Black  and  tan  toy  terriers  especially,  due  to  in-and-in  breeding.  It 
can  also  be  the  result  of. deficient  nutritive  functions  and  debility.  Rub 
the  bare  places  with  an  ointment  made  of —

This  is  a  good  hair  grower,  but  here  is  where  Eberhart's  Skin  Remedy 
will  surely  do  the  work;  never  failing  as  a  hair  grower.  Clayton's  will  do 
the  same  thing. 

"Blain — Is  a  name  given  to  a  vesicular  swelling  of  the  tongue  along 
the  sides  and  underneath.  It  comes  on  suddenly,  is  most  frequent  in  spring 
and  summer,  and  appears  to  be  epidemic,  many  cases  occurring  in  the 
same  neighborhood  at  the  same  time;  it  has  not  been  shown  to  be  contagious, 
and,  although  it  is  not  a  fatal  disease,  it  is  a  very  troublesome  one. 

"The  symptoms  appear  without  warning  and  apparently  without  cause. 
The  first  thing  generally  observed  is  a  considerable  increase  in  the  flow 
of  saliva,  which  dribbles  from  the  mouth.  The  breath  is  foetid,  and  on 
examination  the  tongue  will  be  found  considerably  swollen,  while  if  the 
disease  has  lasted  any  time  there  will  be  observed  large  livid  vesicles,  which 
rupture,  leaving  ulcers;  these  ultimately  assume  a  gangrenous  form  and 
discharge  foetid  matter  tinged  with  blood." 

The  above  description  of  Blain  (malignant  sore  mouth)  I  quote  from 
Dalziel. 

I  have  never  had  a  case  of  this  trouble,  which  is  not  often  found  in 
dogs.  The  following  was  written  on'  this  trouble  by  Dr.  C.  L.  Thulichum 
for  Forest  and  Stream,  and  it  is  through  their  courtesy  that  I  publish  it: 

"Causes  of  this  trouble  are  conjectural,  the  disease  is  most  prevalent 
in  the  spring  and  summer,  and  more  frequently  found  in  the  southern  than 
in  the  northern  latitudes.  I  do  not  -know  of  any  authority  who  assigns  any 
particular  cause  for  this  trouble,  and  although  I  can  not  say  with  any 
certainty  myself,  I  have,  however,  noted  the  following  conditions, 
and  they  may  be  supposable  causes,  but  I  do  not  wish  to  go  on  record 
as  asserting  that  they  are  the  actual  causes,  as  they  are  simply  deductions 
of  my  own. 

"I  was  located  in  the  South  in  practice  some  years  ago,  when  I  first 
saw  a  case  of  this  trouble  in  the  dog.  At  that  time  I  had  on  my  hands 
several  cases  of  anthrax  or  Texas  fever  in  cattle.  I  noted  that  whenever 
I  found  a  case  of  this  trouble  in  the  dog  I  could  also  by  inquiry  find  that 
in  the  neighborhood  some  one  had  not  long  before  lost  a  cow  from  the  cow 
disease,  as  they  called  it.  As  the  dogs  were  allowed,  in  that  section,  to 
run  at  large,  and  as  a  dog  is,  when  at  large,  more  or  less  of  a  scavenger,  I 
concluded  that  either  the  dog  affected  had  found  the  carcass  of  the  cow 
that  had  died  and  been  buried  and  dug  himself  up  a  meal  from  her,  or 
that  following  that  very  desirable  habit  that  most  dogs  are  possessed  of, 
rolling  in  carrion,  he  had  taken  a  roll  in  this  filth,  and  then  in  licking  him- 
self afterward,  had  thus  infected  his  mouth  with  the  disease.  This  as- 
sumption may  be  entirely  wrong,  but  I  give  it  for  what  it  is  worth  and  it 
is  the  most  common  sense  cause  that  I  can  give  for  the  disease  in  the  section 
in  which  I  met  it.  The  English  authorities  do  not  assign  any  cause,  simply 
saying  that  the  attack  often  begins  without  any  apparent  or  previous  illness, 
which  is  so;  the  attack  is  apparently  sudden,  your  dog  seems  well  today 
and ^ tomorrow  has  a  very  sore  mouth. 

"Symptoms. — Dog  may  be  a  little  listless  for  a  day  or  two,  which  may 
not  be  noticed.     Next  and  noticeable  symptom  is  that  he  wants  to  drink  a 


 

great  deal  of  water  and  drools  saliva  from  the  corners  of  the  mouth; 
tongue  is  enlarged  and  thickened.  You  look  into  the  mouth  and  find  it 
covered  on  its  sides  and  under  surface  with  large  vesicles  of  a  red  or  livid 
color,  which  may  end  in  irregular  and  even  gangrenous  ulcers;  the  breath 
is  extremely  offensive  and  discharge  of  salvia  very  great;  dog  will  not  eat 
and  apparently  can  not  swallow,  but  this  is  a  mistake — he  can,  but  won't, 
owing  to  the  great  soreness  of  the  mouth.  If  the  disease  is  not  checked 
now  it  passes  on  to  the  bowels  and  the  dog  dies  with  severe  bloody  dis- 
charges. 

Treatment. — There  is  only  one  that  I  have  ever  found  necessary,  and  if 
you  get  at  the  dog  promptly  before  the  bowel  trouble  commences  I  believe 
you  will  affect  a  cure  in  every  case;  at  least  I  have. 

"G-et  an  ounce  of  the  tincture  of  sanquinaria  canadensis  at  your  drug- 
gist's and  a  camel's  hair  throat  pencil  or  swab  on  wire.  Paint  the  inside  of 
the  mouth  and  tongue  where  affected  with  this,  morning  and  night,  and 
give  a  tablet  of  bichloride  of  mercury,  one-hundredth  of  a  grain,  three 
times  a  day  internally.  Feed  nothing  but  milk  for  several  days  after 
cure  is  effected.  Buttermilk  is  one  of  the  finest  adjuncts  to  a  cure.  You 
watch  the  dog  closely  and  don't  give  him  too  much  water,  not  until  he 
suffers  from  the  lack  of  it,  but  so  that  he  will  be  thirsty  enough  to  drink  the 
buttermilk  when  you  hand  it  to  him.  Have  it  as  cold  as  possible  and  give 
him  a  soup  plate  full  three  times  a  day;  one  day  sweet  milk,  the  next  but- 
termilk. After  he  is  well,  feed  him  for  some  time  boiled  rice  and  milk  and 
buttermilk  and  bring  him  gradually  on  to  his  regular  feed. 

The  above  treatment  I  have  found  to  put  the  mouth  in  such  shape 
that  the  dog  will  take  nourishment  after  the  first  twenty-four  hours,  and 
after  that  he  will  steadily  improve,  and  four  or  five  days  sees  the  mouth 
entirely  healed  except  that  it  is  still  tender  to  solid  food.  To  a  dog  the 
size  of  a  setter  or  hound  you  can  give  as  high  as  a  fiftieth  of  a  grain  at  a 
dose  of  the  bichloride  of  mercury;  to  pups  and  smaller  breeds  one-hun- 
dredth of  a  grain  is  enough,  and  in  fact  I  confine  myself  to  this  dose  with 
all.  sized  dogs  under  St.  Bernards  or  mastiffs,  as  it  is  quite  as  effective  in 
the  smaller  dose  as  in  the  larger." 

Brain,  Inflammation  of  the  (Meningitis). — The  meingess,  the  mem- 
branes enveloping  the  brain,  are  liable  to  inflammation.  Symptoms  are 
great  drowsiness,  with  sudden  spasmodic  movements  of  the  muscles  of  the 
head  and  chest  during  sleep.  The  disease  is  often  produced  by  fits.  In  this 
and  other  brain  troubles  there  is  a  disposition  to  walk  in  circles,  always  to 
one  side,  and  the  sight  is  so  affected  that  the  dog  runs  against  obstacles. 
Treatment  by  the  amateur  is  of  no  avail;  call  in  a  good  veterinarian  or 
your  family  doctor. 

Blisters — See  general  remarks  under  heading  of  Medical  Terms. 

Boils. — This  term,  being  in  common  use,  is  well  understood.  Boils 
are  not  very  common  on  the  dog;  when  they  appear  a  poultice  of  some 
kind  should,  if  practicable,  be  kept  constantly  applied,  in  order  to  bring 
the  boil   quickly  to  a  head,  when   it  should   be  opened  with   a  lancet,   the 
matter  well  squeezed  out  of  it,  the  part  well  washed  with  tepid  water,  and 
then  dressed  with  the  following  ointment:  Turner's  Cerate  (Ceratum  cala- 
mine), 1  oz.;  precipitated  chalk  and  glycerine,  and  carbolic  acid,  each  2 
dr.;  mixed.  If  bicarbonate  of  soda — dose,  ten  grains  for  a  30  lb.  dog — be 
given  three  times  a  day  it  will  check  the  tendency  to  form  boils.  Smaller 
toy  dogs  use  five-grain  doses,  large  breeds  fifteen-grain  doses. 

Blotch. — When  dogs  are  affected  with  blotch,  (Acute  Eczema),  in- 
flamed patches  are  observed  on  various  parts  of  the  body;  these  discharge 
thin  mattery  fluid,  which  forms  a  scab,  matting  the  hair  together,  which 
in  a  few  days  falls  off,  leaving  bare  patches  moist  from  the  exuded  fluid. 
These  will  appear  in  a  night,  and  need  cause  no  alarm  whatever.  Use  for 
a  few  days,  'till  the  spots  are  dried  up,  a  powder  of  equal  parts  of  Boric 
Acid,  bismuth  sub  nit,  and  oxide  of  zinc.  Dust  this  well  in  on  the  in- 
flamed patches  twice  a  day.  After  dried  up  then  use  Eberhart's  skin 
remedy  twice  a  day,  and  it  will  bring  the  hair  back  in  due  time. 

Here  is  a  good  lotion  that  you  can  have  made  if  you  haven't  my  skin 
remedy  on  hand: 

Lotion  for  Blotch. — Take  carbolic  acid  and  glycerine  (British  Phar- 
macopoeia), 1  oz.;  laudanum,  2  oz.;  water,  iy2  pts.;  carbonate  of  potash, 
2  drs.  It  should  be  applied  over  the  whole  surface  of  the  skin  affected 
twice   a    day. 

A  bath  or  two,  except  in  cold  weather,  will  facilitate  a  cure,  using 
Eberhart's,  or  some  good  dog  soap,  warm  water  to  which  add  a  teaspoonful 
of  carbonate  of  soda,  and  the  dog  afterwards  very  carefully  dried. 

Of  course,  the  kennel  must  be  examined,  any  defective  sanitary  arrange- 
ments altered,  and  thorough  cleanliness  insisted  on.  The  dog's  bedding 
should  be  changed  at  least  every  other  day,  and  the  proper  use  of  dis- 
infectants in  and  about  the  kennel  are  of  great  use. 

Breeding,  To  Prevent. — To  prevent  a  bitch  from  breeding  after  she 
has  gone  astray,  accidentally  been  bred,  wash  out  the  womb  with  a  strong 
solution  of  alum  and  water,  using  the  ordinary  syringe  with  the  female 
point  adjusted.  The  sooner  this  is  done  after  the  act  of  coition  the  better. 
It  will  often  prove  successful,  especially  if  the  bitch  is  in  the  early  stages 
of  oestrum.  A  fairly  strong  solution  of  Condy's  Fluid,  with  5  gr.  of  sul- 
phate of  zinc  to  each  ounce,  has  also  been  successfully  employed. 

Another,  and  very  sure  thing  I  have  found  is,  as  soon  as  they  are 
loose,  have  syringe  ready,  filled  with  pure  cider  vinegar,  say  half  a  tea- 
cup, hold  bitch's  hind  parts  up  and  inject  this  in  the  vagina.  The  super- 
matazoa  can  not  live  in  any  acid  solution.  The  injection  should  be  quickly 
done,  after  they  are  apart. 

Bronchocele. — This  is  an  enlargement  of  the  thyroid  glands,  the  prin- 
cipal cartilage  of  the  larynx.     See  Goitre. 

Bronchitis. — This  is  an  inflammation  of  the  bronchial  tubes  or  wind 
pipes  that  convey  the  air  to  the  lungs,  the  upper  portion  called  the  larynx. 
It  is  caused  by  exposure  to  damp  and  cold,  neglecting  a  common  cold,  of 


 

being  kenneled  where  foul  emanations  are  breathed.  Excessive  barking, 
as  dogs  often  do  at  their  first  bench  show,  will  cause  a  slight  inflammation 
of  the  larynx.  When  the  larger  air  pipes  are  only  affected,  the  cough 
is  a  short,  dry,  intermittent  one  at  first,  but  in  a  few  days  it  becomes  more 
frequent  and  moist,  mucus  is  discharged  from  the  nose  and  coughed  up  as 
well.  When  the  smaller  brancnes  are  attacked  the  cough  is  more  severe, 
there  is  a  constant  wheezing,  and  frothy  matter  tinged  with  blood  is  ex- 
pectorated; the  breath  is  hot,  mouth  and  nose  dry  and  hot,  the  tongue 
is  parched,  the  pulse  is  weak  and  considerably  increased,  eyes  are  red 
and  inflamed,  the  discharge  from  the  nose  becoming  thick  and  copious,  and 
the  dog  suffers  from  violent  sneezing. 

Treatment. — Put  the  dog  in  a  room  tolerably  warm,  one  with  a  fire  in 
it  is  best,  where  a  tea-kettle  is  kept  boiling,  as  the  steam  thus  distributed 
throughout  the  room  is  very  beneficial,  but  ventilation  is  also  essential. 
A  room  with  a  fireplace  in  it  would  insure  this.  Give  the  dog  one  dose 
of  from  three  to  five  grains  of  true  James'  Powder.  As  a  mild  laxative, 
give  a  dose  of  castor  oil.  For  food,  give  broths  or  porridge,  with  -bits  of 
boiled  liver  added. 

Where  there  is  an  accumulation  of  phlegm,  and  the  animal  endeavors 
to  dislodge  it,  dive  a  dessertspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  of  ipecacuanha 
wine  to  act  as  an  emetic.  This  will  greatly  relieve  the  patient.  If  the 
cough  is  troublesome,  give  from  a  dessertspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  of  the 
following  twice  a  day: 

Liquor  morphise  mur    2   drams 

Spirit  of  ether  sulp.  co    2   drams 

Tincture  of  camphor  co 3   drams 

Ipecacuanha  wine    1   dram 

Water   to   make    3   ounces 

Or  3  gr.  to  5  gr.  of  benzoic  aid  will  relieve  the  cough.  Apply  hot  linseed 
poultices  to  the  chest  and  sides,  and  always  place  a  coat  upon  the  dog.  A 
woolen  cloth  or  blanket  will  do  for  this,  covering  his  chest  and  around  his 
body  two-thirds  towards  rear,  fastened  with  safety  pins. 

The  following  medicine,  in  the  form  of  a  thin  electuary,  should  then 
be  administered  to  the  patient   every  three   hours: 

Electuary  for  Bronchitis  and  Sore  Throat: 

Chlorate   of  potash    3  drams 

Wine   of  ipecacuanha    3  drams 

Tincture  of  opium 2  drams 

Powdered   licorice  root    %  ounce 

Powdered  gum  acacia    %  ounce 

Honey     1  ounce 

Vinegar  of  squills y2  ounce 

Mix  and  give  to  small  dogs,  up  to  2  5-lb.  weight,  half  a  teaspoonful 
every  three  hours,  and  to  large  dogs  a  teaspoonful  as  a  dose.     Shake  bottle 


 

well  before  giving,  as  these  ingredients  have  a  tendency  to  separate.  It 
should  be  placed  well  back  on  the  tongue  and  should  be  swallowed  gradually. 
Is  is  sometimes  advisable  to  blister  the  throat  and  front  of  the  chest, 
and  in  most  cases  a  good  rubbing  with  a  strong  stimulative  liniment  will 
be  of  service.     Vinegar  and  mustard  may  be  used,  or  the  following  mixed: 

Spirits  of  turpentine 1  y2    ounce 

Oil  of  origanum    1   ounce 

Tincture  of  cantharides    \'2    ounce 

Spirit   of   hartshorn    1   ounce 

Rape    oil     2   ounces 

Bronchitis  often  assumes  a  chronic  form,  especially  in  old  dogs,  when 
the  cough  is  husky  and  constant,  retching  and  discharge  of  phlegm,  the 
breathing  short  and  thick,  and  the  dog  is  incapable  of  much  exertion. 
Chronic  cases  are  incurable,  but  alleviation  can  be  given  when  it  is  unusually 
bad  by  giving  a  desertspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful,  according  to  size  of  dog, 
of  equal  parts  of  oxymel  of  squills  and  thick  mucilage  of  acacia  several 
times  a   day. 

Another  veterinarian  advises  as  follows: 

"This  trouble  is  of  frequent  occurrence  and  is  due  to  an  inflammation 
of  the  air  passage  leading  down  into  the  body  of  the  lung,  and  may  be  the 
result  of  a  cold  or  chill  or  the  breathing  of  smoke  or  novious  vapors.  The 
symptoms  are  more  or  less  difficulty  in  breathing,  severe  and  constant 
coughing  and  the  accumulation  of  phlegm  in  the  windpipe.  In  bad  cases 
the  patient  will  not  lie  down,  but  sits  with  the  forelegs  braced  and  the 
chest  expanded.  In  treating  place  in  a  room  comfortably  warm  without 
being  overheated,  and  moisten  the  air  by  keeping  a  kettle  going.  If  the 
throat  is  so  full  of  phlegm  that  breathing  is  difficult  give  an  emetic  of  the 
wine  of  ipecac  in  doses  of  a  half  to  two  teaspoonfuls,  repeated  in  one 
hour,  if  necessary.  After  the  stomach  is  erupted  and  the  patient  has  quieted 
use  the  following  mixture:  Paragoric  six  drams,  Hoffman's  spirits  two 
drams,  ipecacuanha  wine  one  dram,  syrum  of  squills  one  ounce,  water  to 
make  three  ounces.  The  dose  is  a  teaspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  every 
four  or  six  hours.  Keep  the  bowels  open  by  occasional  doses  of  aperient 
medicine  and  repeat  the  emetic  if  the  breathing  has  not  improved  in  forty- 
eight  hours,  and  after  the  acute  stage  of  the  disease  has  passed  and  the 
cough  is  better  give  cod  liver  oil  emulsion.  Feed  on  milk,,  meat  broths  and 
soup  during  the  early  stages  of  the  disease,  and  as  the  severe  symptoms 
abate  meat  may  be  given. 

Bronchitis    (Chronic   Husk) This   condition    is   the   result   of   a    more 

or  less  chronic  thickening  of  the  membranes  lining  the  air  passages,  so  that 
the  dog  is  in  apparent  good  health  with  the  exception  of  a  hard,  dry,  husky 
cough  that  is  brought  on  by  any  excitement  or  exertion,  and  is  usually 
worse  in  the  morning  and  at  night.     These  attacks  of  coughing  end  usually 


 

in  a  retching  and  gagging,  as  if  vomiting  or  expelling  a  piece  of  phlegm 
from  the  throat.  Give  aperient  medicine  so  as  to  keep  the  bowels  open 
and  use  the  following  mixture:  Tincture  of  nux  vomica  thirty  drops,  syrup 
of  squills  one  ounce,  water  to  make  three  ounces;  dose  from  half  a  tea- 
spoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  three  times  a  day  after  feeding,  the  first  for 
a  toy,  the  second  for  a  St.  Bernard  or  one  of  the  larger  breeds.  If  the 
cough  is  very  severe  give  from  fifteen  drops  to  a  teaspoonful  of  glyco- 
heroin  in  water.  Feed  underdone  meat,  raw  eggs,  gelatine  or  any  easily 
digested  food  that  will  not  distend  the  stomach  unduly,  as  a  distension  of 
the  stomach  brings  pressure  on  the  chest  and  aggravates  the  condition." 

Bowels  (Intussusception). — This  trouble  is  of  more  frequent  occur- 
rence in  puppies  than  old  dogs.  It  is  the  result  of  the  bowel  telescoping 
upon  itself.  By  careful  manipulation  of  the  abdomen  it  can  be  located  by 
a  long,  hard  swelling.  The  patient  suffers  much  pain  and  usually  whines 
and  cries  pitifully.  The  other  symptoms  are  diarrhea,  with  blood-tinged 
mucus,  and  in  the  early  stages  vomiting.  Intussusception  is  due  to  a  variety 
of  causes,  such  as  worms,  indigestion  and  colic,  or  the  eating  of  hard 
substances,  but  as  indigestion,  colic  and  the  abnormal  appetite  that  causes 
dogs  to  eat  indigestible  and  irritating  matter  are  more  or  less  the  result 
of  the  presence  of  worms,  the  latter  must  be  accepted  as  the  primary 
cause.  The  importance  of  treating  for  them  frequently  is  therefore  ap- 
parent. In  treating  mild  cases  that  have  not  progressed  far  give  from 
one  to  five  drops  of  laudanum 'every  three  hours  in  a  teaspoonful  of  milk. 
One  drop  is  the  correct  dose  for  a  puppy  two  to  three  months  old  of  the 
toy  breeds  and  five  drops  is  the  dose  for  the  large  breeds  of  the  age  men- 
tioned. Feed  only  liquid  food — milk  or  beef  tea.  If  there  is  not  a  decided 
improvement  in  the  puppy's  condition  in  twenty-four  hours  an  operation 
should  be  resorted  to.  In  the  early  stages  it  is  nearly  always  successful 
and  the  puppy  receives  immediate  relief.  If  it  is  postponed  the  operation 
is  more  difficult,  on  account  of  the  inflammation,  and  the  bowels  cannot 
be  so  easily  straightened.  The  patient  should  fast  for  twenty-four  hours 
following  the  operation,  after  which  for  a  few  days  administer  only  liquids. 

Breasts  (Inflammation) . — This  painful  condition  usually  attacks  bitches 
while  nursing  their  puppies,  the  abscesses  that  are  liable  to  form  at  other 
times  being  generally  of  slower  growth  and  not  accompanied  by  systemic 
disturbance.  The  milk  gland  in  acute  cases  is  swollen,  hard  and  red  and 
very  painful,  and  the  elevation  of  temperature  indicates  the  formation  of 
pus.  After  two  or  three  days  the  swelling  becomes  softer,  comes  to  a 
point,  breaks  and  freely  discharges.  If  the  bitch  is  nursing  it  is  necessary 
usually  to  remove  the  puppies  and  feed  them  by  hand  or  turn  them 
over  to  a  foster-mother,  the  mother  meanwhile  being  milked  two  or  three 
times  a  day.  The  swellings  should  be  poulticed  with  flaxseed  until  they 
are  soft,  and  then  lanced.  As  a  rule  they  do  not  require  any  other  treat- 
ment, for  their  dependent  position  insures  free  drainage.  It  is  advisable 
to  keep  the  patient's  bowels  open  with  a  dose  of  aperient  medicine. 

Biliousness. — Symptoms  are  vomiting  in  the  morning  of  frothy  yellow 


 

bile,  usually  after  eating  grass,  an  unusual  thirst,  sometimes  a  diarrhoea, 
refusal  of  food,  and  in  some  cases  the  eyes  and  mouth  and  skin  take  on 
a  yellow  cast.  For  treatment  first  give  a  dose  of  castor  oil,  so  as  to  keep 
the  bowels  open  and  remove  the  excess  of  bile.  If  there  is  much  nausea 
and  sickness  of  the  stomach  give  carbonate  of  bismuth.  A  dose  of  from 
two  to  twelve  grains  simply  should  be  placed  on  the  tongue  and  the  mouth 
held  for  a  moment  until  it  is  swallowed.  If  this  does  not  give  good  results 
use  the  following  prescription:  Diluted  hydrocyanic  acid  twenty  drops, 
liquor  bismuth  one  ounce,  water  to  make  six  ounces.  The  dose  is  from 
a  teaspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  every  three  hours.  In  most  of  these 
cases  giving  the  stomach  a  complete  rest  will  do  more  good  than  anything 
in  the  way  of  drugs.  In  some  cases  good  results  follow  the  use  of  small 
doses  of  quinine  or  the  extract  of  taraxacum. 

Bed    Sores Large,    unhealthy-looking    sores    frequently    form    on    the 

hips,  points  of  the  buttocks,  shoulders  and  other  parts  of  dogs  which  have 
suffered  from  severe  illness.  Success  in  treatment  depends  upon  protect- 
ing the  parts  affected  from  further  injury.  First  clean  the  parts  with  a 
warm,  saturated  solution  of  boracic  acid,  then  dry  carefully  with  soft  linen 
rags  and  dust  with  powdered  boracic  acid  and  iodoform  in  equal  parts; 
encircle  the  injured  parts  with  a  ring  of  felt,  kept  in  position  with  adhesive 
tape. 

Bladder  (irritable). — These  cases  as  a  rule  require  the  attention  of 
a  veterinary,  as  the  irritation  may  be  set  up  by  a  variety  of  causes,  not 
the  least  of  which  is  a  stone  in  the  bladder.  The  common  symptom  of 
bladder  trouble  is  constant  straining,  even  when  indoors;  in  other  cases, 
not  so  bad,  there  is  frequent  micturition  of  high-colored,  cloudy,  strong- 
smelling  urine.  The  presence  of  blood,  as  a  rule,  is  an  indication  of  calcu- 
lus, or  stone.  Sometimes  the  blood  comes  mixed  with  the  urine,  and  in 
other  cases  it  comes  in  drops  after  the  passing  of  water.  In  those  cases 
where  the  stone  becomes  fixed  in  the  pasage,  and  the  dog  is  incapable  of 
micturition,  no  time  should  be  lost  in  calling  in  a  good  veterinary  sur- 
geon. If  there  is  not  much  pain  a  course  of  treatment  with  the  hyposul- 
phite of  soda  is  all  that  is  necessary,  the  dose  being  from  three  to  twenty 
grains,  diluted  in  water  and  administered  three  times  a  day  before  feeding. 
If  there  is  much  pain,  give  the  tincture  of  hyoscyamus  in  dose  of  from 
two  to  fifteen  drops  in  water  every  three  hours.  Feed  on  milk,  barley  wa- 
ter and  dog  cakes. 

Broken  Bones. — It  can  be  ascertained  that  a  bone  of  the  leg  is  broken 
by  taking  hold  of  the  limb  above  the  supposed  fracture  and  moving  the 
lower  portion  against  it,  when  a  grating  or  crackling  of  the  broken  ends 
against  each  other  will  be  felt  or  heard.  The  treatment  consists  in  ad- 
justing the  fractured  parts  to  their  natural  form,  and  applying  splints  to 
keep  the  parts  set.  Splints  may  be  made  of  strips  of  gutta  percha,  softened 
in  warm  water  and  moulded  to  fit  the  limb,  or  pieces  of  thin  wood  may  be 
cut  the  required  size  and  well  padded  with  wadding.  The  splints  can  be 
kept   in   place   by  binding   evenly  with   light   cotton   bandages,   which,   pre- 


 

vious  to  application,  have  been  smeared  with  the  following  preparation 
whilst  warm:  Take  Venice  turpentine,  Burgundy  pitch,  equal  parts;  melt 
and  smear  over  the  bandage  whilst  hot.  If  much  swelling  occurs,  it  will 
be  necessary  to  slacken  the  bandages,  and,  in  most  cases,  it  will  be  requisite 
to  muzzle  the  dog  to  prevent  him  tearing  off  the  splints.  Perfect  rest  will 
be  required,  and  the  general  health  attended  to.  The  time  it  will  take 
for  the  bones  to  unite  is  uncertain,  but  always  tedious. 

Unless  you  feel  capable  of  handling  the  case  properly  yourself  you  had 
better  call  in  a  verterinarian  or  your  family  physician.  Your  druggist  could 
do  this  in  case  neither  the  veterinarian  or  doctor  could  be  had. 

Bowels,  Obstruction  of  the   (Constipation  or  Costiveness) — Dogs  kept 

in  the  house  and  not  exercised  sufficiently,  or  improperly  fed,  are  particularly 
liable  to  constipation.  Bones,  while  excellent  and  almost  necessary  to  a 
dog's  health,  yet  an  excessive  use  of  them  is  to  be  avoided,  also  any  one 
kind  of  dry  food,  and  no  dog  should  be  kept  constantly  on  one  kind  of  food, 
as  want  of  exercise  and  the  absence  of  necessary  variety  in  the  food  are 
the  principal  causes  of  constipation. 

When  looked  upon  as  a  disease  itself,  or  as  a  symptom  and  attendant 
on  other  diseases,  it  is  always  troublesome  and  often  becomes  dangerous. 
The  feces  accumulate  and  get  pressed  into  hardened  lumps,  the  belly  is 
distended  and  hard,  the  colic  pains  occur,  driving  the  dog  almost  frantic 
and  causing  him  to  run  about  blindly,  stumbling  over  different  obstacles 
in  this  way,  and  to  give  utterance  every  now  and  the  nto  sharp  howls  of 
pain.  All  this  pain  and  misery  that  the  poor  dog  has  to  suffer  in  nearly 
every  case,  is  the  result  of  neglect  of  proper  rules  which  every  dog  owner 
should,  in  common  justice  to  the  dog,  be  acquainted  with  and  observe.  But 
the  evil  does  not  end  here,  for  it  is  the  too  common  practice  to  rush  into 
one  of  commission  quite  as  great  or  greater — namely,  the  common  practice 
in  constipation  of  resorting  to  strong  purgatives,  such  as  epsom  salts,  jalop, 
calomel,  etc.,  the  consequence  of  giving  which  is  to  render  the  evil  worse 
by  forcing  the  feces  into  still  less  compass  when  it  becomes  more  impacked 
and  hardened  than  before.  The  proper  course  to  follow  is,  when  the  dog 
is  in  great  pain,  administer  a  dose  of  the  anti-spasmodic  drops.  Compound 
spirits  of  sulphuric  ether  and  tincture  of  opium  (laudanum)  equal  parts. 
Mix  and  keep  in  a  well-stoppered  bottle  in  a  cool  place.  The  dose  for  a 
20-lb.  to  30-lb.  dog  would  be  a  small  teaspoonful  given  in  about  two 
tablespoonfuls  of  milk,  gruel  or  other  liquid.  Success  in  relieving  the  pa- 
tient is  best  obtained  by  mechanical  means.  Clysters  of  thin  oatmeal  gruel 
or  soap  and  water,  lukewarm,  and  containing  about  one  ounce  of  castor 
oil  in  each  half  pint,  must  be  used  continuously  for  some  time,  in  fact  till 
the  desired  object  has  been  attained.  This  end  will  be  greatly  facili- 
tated by  first  introducing  the  finger,  oiled,  into  the  rectum,  and  removing  as 
much  of  the  hard  lumps  of  feces  as  can  be  reached.  Assistance  will  also 
be  given  to  the  action  of  the  clysters  by  gently  pressing  or  kneading  the 
belly  at  intervals  with  the  hand.  It  is  necessary  that  everything  should 
be  done  with  the  greatest  gentleness;  boisterous  conduct  and  rough  hand- 
ling being  likely  to  alarm   the  patient  and   cause  him   to   do   himself  irre- 


 

parable    injury-      When    the    lower    bowels    have    been    emptied    follow    it 
up  by  giving  the  dog  a  strong  dose  of  Podophyllin  pills: 

Podolphylln     6  grains 

Compound  extract  of  colocynth    30  grains 

Powdered    rhubarb    48  grains 

Extract  of  henbane 36  grains 

Mix  and  divide  into  twenty-four  pills.  The  dose  is  from  one-half  to 
two  pills,  according  to  age  and  size,  and  it  is  advisable  to  give  the  dog  a  little 
warm  broth  after  the  pill  to  assist  in  its  action. 

The  use  of  purgatives  must  not  be  resorted  to,  to  prevent  a  recurrence 
of  the  disease.  The  system  of  management  must  be  altered,  the  dog  must 
have  daily  exercise,  the  food  must  be  varied  and  embrace  a  portion  of 
boiled  green  vegetables  at  least  every  second  or  third  day.  For  a  week 
or  so  after  the  attack  rather  sloppy  food  should  be  given,  such  as  welf- 
boiled  porridge  and  milk,  or  broth,  and  an  occasional  meal  of  boiled  liver 
will  act  as  a  gentle  laxative. 

Worms  are  another  cause  of  obstruction  in  the  intestines,  especially  in 
puppies;  round  worms  get  coiled  into  balls,  set  up  local  irritation  and 
interfere  with  the  natural  action  of  the  bowels. 

BLACK  TONGUE.  —

This  is  a  new  disease,  confined  so  far,  to  dogs  in  the  Southern  states. 
Personally,  I  have  never  seen  a  case  of  it,  and  do  not  pretend  to  try  to  ad- 
vise as  to  treatment.  The  following  was  written  by  the  late  Polk  Miller 
of  Richmond,  Va.,  (and  a  valued  friend  of  mine  he  was),  and  I  am  giving 
his  article  and  treatment,  due  to  the  great  confidence  I  felt  in  him  as  a 
gentleman  sportsman,  and  lover  of  dogs. 

BLACK  TONGUE   OR  THE   "NEW  DISEASE."  —

There  is  a  new  disease  among  the  dogs  in  our  Southern  States,  and  in 
some  of  the  Northern  and  Western  States  (though  to  a  limited  extent), 
which  is  giving  great  trouble  and  anxiety  among  dog-owners.  I  say  new, 
because  it  has  appeared  in  the  last  ten  years.  It  is  called  "Black  Tongue" 
by  the  majority  of  people,  but  as  that  does  not  appear  in  all  cases,  it  is 
called  the  "New  Disease."  A  dog  which  is  perfectly  well  today  may  be 
extremely  ill  tomorrow,  'and  if  the  disease  is  not  arrested  in  twenty-four  to 
thirty-six  hours,  it  generally  proves  fatal.  A  close  watch  should  be  kept  to 
see  that  it  doesn't  get  too  good  a  start.  The  symptoms,  as  nearly  as  I 
can  describe  them,  are  as  follows:  General  languor,  dullness  about  the 
eyes,  little  or  no  appetite,  a  dryness  about  the  mouth  and  throat  (some- 
times swelling),  and  high  fever.  In  some  cases  the  glands  are  excited 
and  a  profuse  flow  of  saliva  is  noticed,  but  in  most  cases  the  tongue  is 
dry,  and  the  poor  brute  seems  anxious,  though  unable,  to  swallow  water, 
on  account  of  inability  to  lap  the  liquid.  These  are  some  of  the  most 
noticeable    symptoms,    and    the    dog    thus    affected    is    indisposed    to    notice 


 

the  call  or  caresses  of  his  master,  and  manifests  a  disposition  to  roam 
about  in  a  listles  manner,  preferring  to  be  "severely  left  alone."  What- 
ever may  be  the  opinion  of  others  as  to  a  proper  treatment,  or  a  name  for 
this  disease,  it  is  my  belief,  from  personal  experience  with  it,  that  it 
should  be  treated  in  the  same  manner  as  our  old  physicians  treated  diph- 
theria in  human  beings  before  the  new  remedy — anti-toxin — was  discov- 
ered. I  give  that,  and  trust  that  the  lives  of  many  dogs  that  would  other- 
wise die  may  be  saved.  I  have  never  failed  to  cure  a  dog  by  the  prompt  use 
of  this  treatment  at  the  very  first  appearance  of  the  trouble,  and  I  have 
never  known  one  to  get  well  when  two  days  have  elapsed  before  the  rem- 
edy  was   applied: 

Chlorate  of  Potassium V2    ounce 

Mur.   Tine.   Iron    Vz    ounce 

Water     1   pint 

Sig. — Mix,  shake,  and  with  a  soft  rag  protruding  over  the  end  of  a 
stick,  dip  into  the  solution  and  thoroughly  mop  out  the  mouth  and  throat 
twice    daily,    for   two    days. 

The  following  was  written  by  someone  south,  who  seemed  to  know 
from  experience  as  to  Black  Tongue.  The  3  grain  dose  given  of  thymol,  was 
used  on  a  Foxhound,  probably  a  fifty  pound  dog,  therefore  exercise  judg- 
ment, (as  thymol  is  a  dangerous  drug),  for  smaller  dogs: 

"As  to  black  tongue,  I  use  the  thymol,  as  it  is  a  better,  antiseptic 
for  the  intestinal  tract,  and,  in  addition  to  this  I  use  alternately  a  wash  of 
permanganate  of  potash  and  a  saturated  watery  solution  of  alum.  I  give 
the  thymal  rubbed  up  with  pure  Castile  soap  and  put  into  capsules,  giving 
one  capsule  containing  three  grains  of  thymol  every  four  hours.  I  wash  the 
mouth  out  before  each  capsule  is  given,  alternating  with  the  two  solutions 
mentioned   above. 

As  the  dog  sick  with  black  tongue  will  not  eat,  as  a  rule,  I  drench 
him  with  milk  morning  and  night,  sometimes  adding  a  raw  egg  to  the 
milk. 

I  want  to  give  just  a  few  warnings  to  those  unfamiliar  with  the  use 
of  thymol.  Its  use  in  the  human  being  is  attended  with  a  certain  amount  of 
danger,  and  this  is  doubly  so  in  the  dog.  It  should  never  be  given  to  a 
dog  until  the  intestinal  tract  has  been  thoroughly  cleaned  out  with  salts. 
The  dog  should,  then  be  starved  for  at  least  twelve  hours  before  the  thy- 
mol is  administered,  and  this  should  be  followed  in  six  hours  with  another 
dose  of  salts.  The  dog  should  then  be  given  nothing  to  eat  for  several 
hours  more.  Under  no  circumstances  should  the  dog  be  allowed  any 
fat  for  several  hours  after  the  last  dose  of  salts  and  he  should  have 
nothing  whatever  to  eat  between  the  first  and  last  dose  of  salts. 

Several  fatal  cases  of  poisoning  are  on  record  from  the  use  of  thymol 
in  the  treatment  of  hookworm  in  the  human.  Chenopodium,  or  the  oil  of 
wormseed,  is  a  far  safer  drug  to  use.  In  addition  to  its  being  a  safer 
drug,  it  has  been  proven  that  it  effects  cures  of  hookworm  in  the  human 
where  thymol  has  been  given  and  has  failed.  In  the  Journal  of  the  Amer- 
ican   Medical    Association    of .  November    28,    1914,    Dr.    Robert    L.    Levy    of 


 

Johns  Hopkins  Hospital  reports  two  cases  of  hookworm  treated  and  cured 
with  oil  of  wormseed  where  thymol  had  failed.  He  also  gives  the  'coeffi- 
cient of  efficacy'  in  the  same  percentage  as  the  article  you  have  quoted. 
He  gives  the  following  mode  of  administration:  First  day— Liquid  diet; 
8  p.  m.  one  ounce  Epsom  salts.  Second  day — Omit  .breakfast  and  lunch; 
at  5  a.  m.  one  ounce  of  Epsom  salts;  at  7,  9  and  11,  sixteen  drops  of  oil 
chenopodium  on  a  little  granulated  sugar;  1  p.  m.  one  ounce  castor  oil 
containing  fifty  minims  of  chloroform;  soft  supper  (this  for  a  dog  would 
be  a  little  baker's  bread  soaked  in   milk).      Third  day — Resume  full  diet." 

Another  southern   writer  has   this  to  say: 

"While  it  has  not  been  definitely  determined  whether  or  not  this  dis- 
ease is  due  to  hookworm  infestment,  indications  suggest  a  very  close  relation, 
as  postmortem  examinations  have  shown  hookworms  and  great  intestinal 
inflammation.  Ii  is  probable  that  the  toxin  which  the  hookworm  injects 
into  the  dog's  blood  may  cause  the  disease.  It  is  not  contagious,  nor 
can  it  be  communicated  by  feeding  or  drinking  from  the  same  vessel.  An 
experiment  was  recently  made  by  feeding  parts  of  stomach  and  intestines 
of  a  dog  which  died  of  an  acute  case  of  black  tongue  to  several  healthy 
dogs,  and  no  ill  effects  developed.  Another  fact  that  is  quite  apparent  is 
that  black  tongue  is  never  found  except  in  sections  of  the  country,  which 
includes  the  entire  South,  where  the  hookworm  is  known  to  exist"  As  to 
the  treatment  for  hookworms,  see  "Hookworms"  in  the  regular  worm 
article. 

Colic. — This  subject  is  very  completely  covered  by  Dalziel. 

"Nearly  all  domestic  animals  are  subject  to  attacks  of  colic,  or  pripes, 
as  it  is  more  frequently  termed,  especially  when  the  horse  is  the  subject 
of  the  disease.  In  the  dog,  puppies  are  especially  liable  to  it,  but  it  attacks 
dogs  of  all  ages,  and,  if  not  promptly  attended  to  and  properly  treated,  is 
very  liable  to  end  in  inflammation  of  the  bowels — a  most  dangerous  dis- 
ease, which,  in  some*  of  its  features,  though  happily  not  its  dangerous  ones, 
colic  resembles.  One  very  important  point  of  distinction  is,  that  whereas 
inflammation  comes  on  gradually,  and  feverishness,  with  hot,  dry  nose,  etc., 
always  exist  as  premonitory  symptoms,  colic  comes  on  suddenly,  and  a  dog 
eating  well  and  seeming  in  perfect  health  is  seized  with  spasm  of  the 
coat  of  the  bowels,  causing  such  pain  that  he  gives  voice  to  a  low  moan, 
which  is  afterward  changed  to  a  prolonged  howl,  as  the  paroxysms  of  pain 
increase  in  frequency  and  severity.  In  colic,  too,  the  nose  and  mouth  are 
cool,  and  there  is  no  offensive  breath.  As  in  inflammation,  the  attitude 
is  peculiar  and  unmistakable;  the  back  ebing  arched,  the  feet  drawn  in 
toward  each  other  and  the  tail  tightly  tucked  between  his  legs;  in  colic, 
the  belly  is  sometimes  distended  considerably  with  gas,  and  is  then  known 
as  flatulent  colic.  It  is  a  disease  of  frequent  occurrence  in  dogs,  and  the 
exciting  causes  are  various;  exposure  to  wet  and  cold;  getting  dogs,  espe- 
cially house  dogs,  to  swin  in  cold  inclement  weather,  are  common  causes; 
the  presence  of  worms  in  the  intestines  also  produces  colic.  But  the  most 
common    cause    is    undoubtedly    the    giving    of    improper    food;    sugar    and 


 

other  sweet  things  are  likely  to  produce  it;  puppies  just  after  weaning 
are  very  liable  to  it,  especially  if  they  have  small  lumps  of  meat  or  other 
solid  food  thrown  to  them,  which  they  can  not  well  chew,  but  greedily 
bolt;  or  having  a  portion  of  one  meal  left  in  the  dish  till  the  next  meal 
is  added  is  very  likely  to  produce  it,  because  the  stale  portion  undergoes 
fermentation,  that  is,  becames  sour,  and  the  fermentation  is  carried  on  in 
the  stomach.  Colic  is  sure  to  yield  to  prompt  and  proper  measures,  and 
the  treatment  is  simple  and  safe.  As  soon  as  observed,  give  the  sufferer 
a  dose  of  "anti-spasmodic  drops."  Compound  spirits  of  sulphuric  ether 
(known  as  Hoffmans'  anodyne),  and  tincture  of  opium  (laudanum)  equal 
parts.  Mix,  and  keep  in  a  well  stoppered  bottle  in  a  cool  place.  Dose  for 
15-lb.  to  35-lb.  dog  would  be  a  small  teaspoonful  in  two  teaspoonfuls  of  milk 
or  gruel.  It  must  be  given  diluted  with  thin  gruel,  milk  or  water, 
and  if  immediate  relief  does  not  follow,  administer  a  double  quanitity,  as 
a  clyster  in  gruel,  or  the  dose  may  be  repeated  in  half  an  hour.  In  "flatulent 
colic,"  known  by  the  distended  belly  sounding  like  a  drum  when  tapped  with 
the*  end  of  the  finger,  from  10  to  30  drops  of  spirit  of  sal  volatile  may  be 
advantageously  added  to  dose  of  "anti-spasmodic  drops,"  or  the  following 
draught  may  be  given  and  repeated  in  an  hour  if  the  dog  is  not  relieved: 

Carbonate    of    soda 20   grains 

Aromatic  spirits   of  ammonia 30    drops 

Essence    of    ginger 5   drops 

Laudanum      15  drops 

Peppermint    water 2   tablespoonfuls 

This  is  a  dose  for  a  medium-sized  dog,  such  as  a  pointer  or  a  greyhound. 
For  puppies  and  smaller  breeds  use  less  of  this  as  the  dose.  After  the  attack 
has  subsided  give  the  dog  a  gentle  aperient,  such  as  the  "mild  purge": 

Syrup  of  buckthorn 3   parts 

Syrup  of  white  poppies 1   part 

Castor  oil 2   parts 

Dose  for  dog  15-lb.  to  30-lb.,  is  a  tablespoonful.     Bottle  must  be  well 
shaken   before  using.      Larger  dogs  a  little  more. 

Keep  on  a  laxative  diet,  and  do  not  let  the  dog  have  violent  exercise 
for  a  day  or  so.  Endeavor  to  discover  the  cause  of  the  attack  and  avoid  a 
repetition.  Lead  poisoning  produces  a  peculiar  form  of  colic,  and  clogs 
should  not  have  water  to  drink  that  has  been  collected  in  leaden  cisterns. 

The  using  of  one-eighth  grain  doses  of  morphine  hypodermically  every 
half  hour  or  hour  during  the  attack  of  colic  will  give  relief  very  soon. 

Ooryza  is  the  name  given  to  a  common  cold  when  confined  to  the  nose 
and  eyes,  and  a  running  at  the  nose  and  watery  eyes.  I  have  found  the 
following  plan  to  quickly  cure  it.  Take  a  large  sponge,  wring  it  out  of 
warm  water,  sprinkle  it  freely  with  vinegar  of  squills,  and  hold  it  to  the 
clogs  nose  so  that  he  inhales  the  fumes.  Or,  half  fill  an  upright  jar  or  jug 
of  suitable  size  with  bran,  saturate  it  with  hot  water,  and  sprinkle  over  and 


 

stir  into  the  bran  the  following:  A  tablespoonful  of  ordinary  vinegar,  a 
teaspoonful  of  laudanum,  and  six  drops  of  glycerine,  and  carbolic  acid 
(British  Pharmacopoeia).  Mix,  and  hold  the  dog's  nose  over  it.  This 
quantity  is  a  double  handful  of  bran  in  a  quart,  or  three-pint  jar,  is  suitable 
for  a  20  to  50  pound  dog.  A  good  idea,  if  eyes  continue  to  run,  would  be 
to  use  the  eye  lotion  of  Hydrastes  and  Camphor  water,  which  you  will  find 
given   under   Eye    troubles. 

Claws,  Inflammation  at  the  Roots  of; — Dogs  used  to  the  chase,  or  hunt- 
ing in  scrubby  heather,  or  running  much  over  hard,  uneven  roads,  suffer 
from  s#re  toes;  the  parts  around  the  roots  of  the  claws  are  swollen,  in- 
flamed and  tender,  making  the  dog  lame,  and,  indeed,  almost  unable  to  get 
about;  there  is  redness  between  the  toes,  and  sweating  or  thin  serous 
discharge  therefrom. 

Such  cases  are  often  very  difficult  to  cure.  First  give  a  dose  of  aper- 
ient medicine,  and  keep  the  dog  up,  giving  him  plenty  of  soft  bedding,  and 
a  light  diet.  Foment  the  part  night  and  morning  with  warm  water,  and 
bathe  freely  with  this  lotion:  Calomel,  2  scr. ;  lime  water,  12  oz. ;  mix. 
Shake  the  bottle  well  when  using  it,  which  should  be  done  four  or  five  times 
a  day.  If  the  foregoing  fail,  try  Goulard's  Extract  of  Lead,  2  dr.;  tincture 
of  arnica,  V2  oz.;  distilled  water,  1  pint;  mix  and  apply  freely  four  or  five 
times  a  day.  If  the  case  is  a  very  bad  one,  wrap  the  foot  in  a  piece  of 
lint  saturated  with  the  lotion,  and  pull  over  it  a  chamois  leather  boot, 
which  the  dog  can  be  prevented  from  gnawing  and  pulling  off  by  use  of  a 
muzzle,  over  the  mouth-part  of  which  a  piece  of  canvas  has  been  sewn. 

Concussion  of  the  Brain. — Often  occurs  in  canine  practice,  and  is  due 
to  accidents.  In  most  cases  the  dog  becomes  unconscious,  and  the  breath- 
ing is  heavy  or  usually  nearly  imperceptible.  Gradually  consciousness  re- 
turns, but  often  a  stiffness  of  the  limbs  and  an  uncertain  gait  remains  for 
a  time.  The  treatment  should  consist  in  the  administration  of  stimu- 
lants, but  great  care  must  be  taken  not  to  attempt  forcing  liquid  upon  an 
unconscious  animal,  or  choking  will  be  the  inevitable  result.  Brandy  can  be 
injected  under  the  skin  (subcutaneously).  Ice  when  procurable  should  be 
applied  to  the  head  and  spinal  cord,  and  ammonia  to  the  nostrils.  If  there 
is  a  fracture  of  the  skull  an  operation  will  become  necessary.  A  part  of 
the  bone  may  be  pressing  upon  the  brain,  when  it  would  have  to  be  raised, 
and  so  relieve  the  pressure,  in  which  case  a  vererinarian  must  be  called  at 
once. 

Constipation. — Watch  your  dog  every  day  as  to  condition  of  his  bowels. 
A  dog  properly  fed  and  exercised  will  hardly  ever  be  troubled  with  consti- 
pation. I  turn  my  dogs  out  into  their  yard  each  morning  and  stay  there 
a  few  minutes  and  watch  them.  Their  first  inclination  is  to  hunt  a  place 
and  empty  themselves  (a  dog's  natural  habit).  If  I  find  one  that  is  con- 
stipated, by  this  I  mean  unnaturally  so,  where  passage  is  too  hard  and 
crumbles  up  into  dust  by  putting  your  foot  on  it,  I  watch  that  dog  that 
night,  and  if  still  the  same  it  gets  a  dose  of  castor  oil  the  next  morning, 
unless  as   sometimes  happens, the   bowels  have  meanwhile  corrected   them- 


 

selves.  No  dog  should  go  over  twenty-four  hours  without  a  passage,  and 
better  if  not  so  long.  As  to  the  size  of  the  dose  of  castor  oil  this  depends 
greatly  on  size  and  age  of  dog.  Take  a  grown  dog  the  size  of  a  fox  terrier 
or  pug,  by  this  is  meant  a  dog  over  a  year  old,  and  you  can  give  it  a  table- 
spoonful.  If  this  don't  work  in  an  hour  or  so,  repeat  the  dose  once.  A 
dog  a  year  old  or  over,  like  an  English  setter,  could  stand  two  tablespoons- 
ful  at  a  dose,  while  the  larger  breeds  like  a  St.  Bernard,  could  stand  an 
ounce  and  a  half,  which  would  be  three  tablespoonsful,  or  even  two  ounces 
at  a  dose.  Some  dogs,  like  some  persons,  are  harder  to  physic  than  others, 
so  that  judgment  should  be  used;  the  idea  being  not  to  give  too  much, 
but  just  enough  to  accomplish  the  desired  result.  Fluid  extract  of  cascara 
sagrada  is  a  remedy  much  used  for  constipation,  and  to  the  dose  of«castor 
oil  from  five  to  twenty  drops  of  this  can  be  added  and  given  with  it  with 
benefit. 

Puppies  from  six  months  to  a  year  old  should  be  given  smaller  doses 
in  proportion  to  age  and  breed  of  dog. 

Young  puppies  as  a  rule  should  have  rather  loose  bowels  than  other- 
wise, and  are  rarely  ever  troubled  with  constipation. 

Watch  your  dog's  bowels,  which  is  easily  done  by  spending  a  few  min- 
utes each  morning  after  it  is  let  out  in  the  yard.  Often  if  only  slightly 
bound  up,  or  passage  is  a  bit  too  hard,  a  little  oatmeal  (same  as  you  cook 
it  for  yourself),  or  some  cooked  liver  for  its  breakfast,  or  a  good  drink 
of  buttermilk  will  loosen  it  up  all  right,  in  place  of  the  oil.  If  passage 
is  normal  (shaped  and  not  hard),  do  nothing  at  all.  Every  dog  should 
empty  itself  at  least  twice  a  clay  and  puppies  oftener. 

Some  dogs  are  troubled  with  chronic  constipation,  and  in  such  cases, 
use  a  laxative  pill,  several  of  which  are  made  for  dogs.  I  have  found  Clay- 
ton's very  good. 

Cough. — Cough,  strictly  speaking,  is  a  symptom  of  disease,  rather  than 
a  disease  itself,  but  it  is  in  very  many  cases  to  non-professional  observation 
the  most  distinct  sign  that  something  is  wrong;  indeed,  so  markedly  is  this 
the  case  that  we  speak  of  a  person  having  a  bad  cough  as  the  ailment  from 
which  he  suffers,  rather  than  the  symptom  of  that  ailment,  and  hence  we 
have  innumerable  specific  remedies  as  cough  mixtures,  cough  pills,  etc. 
Our  dog  we  treat  in  the  same  way,  taking  the  sign  for  the  substance,  the 
smoke  for  the  fire,  and  fortunately  without  much  practical  harm,  for  gen- 
erally speaking,  the  medicine  that  will  ease  a  cough  is  acting  favorably 
on  the  disease  of  which  the  cough  is  an  evidence.  To  decide  what  parti- 
cular disease  is  indicated  by  the  cough,  the  concomitant  symptoms  and 
circumstances,  as  described  under  the  special  disease,  which  are  usually 
preceded  or  accompanied  by  cough,  must  be  taken  into  account,  and  the 
special  treatment  called  for  in  each  case  followed.  Coughs  vary  as  much 
in  character  as  do  the  diseases  of  which  they  are  in  many  cases  the  most 
pronounced  indication.  Thus,  in  common  cold  the  cough  slight  and  humid; 
in  bronchitis,  hard,  dry  and  frequent;  and  in  inflammation  of  the  lungs 
and  pleurisy,  short  and  suppressed,  doubtless  from  the  great  pain  caused  by 
the  effort.  When  the  throat  is  sore,  the  cough  is  hoarse  and  generally  ac- 
companied by  more  or  less  difficulty  in  swallowing;   in  asthma,  the  cough 


 

may  be  described  as  wheezy,  and  is  often  followed  by  vomiting.  Cough 
in  distemper  has  a  peculiar  husky,  hollow  sound.  Cough  may  be  pro- 
duced by  a  bit  of  bone  or  other  substance  sticking  in  the  throat  and  causing 
irritation,  in  which  case  the  cough  is  the  natural  effort  to  get  relief,  and 
ceases  with  the  removal  of  the  irritating  cause.  As  a  cough  is  almost  in- 
variably connected  with  some  derangement  of  the  respiratory  organs  or 
air  passages,  its  warning  should  never  be  neglected,  and  the  early  resort 
to  the  use  of  the  following  pills  will  be  sure  to  relieve,  will  frequently  cure, 
and  can,  under  no  circumstances,  do  any  harm: 

COUGH  PILL. 

Powdered   ipecacuanha    6   grains 

Powdered   opium    6   grains 

Compound   squill    pill    24   grains 

Powdered  gum  ammoniacum    2  4   grains 

Powdered    licorice 24   grains 

Powdered    rhubarb     12    grains 

Mix  and  make  into  twenty-four  pills;  dose  for  a  15-lb.  to  40-lb.  dog, 
one  pill  night  and  morning;  under  15-lbs.  half  a  pill,  and  for  large 
breeds  give  1 V2  pills  as  a  dose. 

Another  very  good  cough  mixture  for  many  kinds  of  coughs  is: 

Muriate   of  ammonia    2   drams 

Compond  syrup  morphia    2   ounces 

Aqua   destil    2   ounces  . 

Dose:  From  half  to  a  teaspoonful  every  two  hours  according  to  size 
of  dog.     For  puppies  10  to  15  drops  as  a  dose. 

For  a  Bronchial  Cough  (Chronic). — The  following  is  a  very  good  one. 
A  teaspoonful  is  the  dose,  as  this  cough  is,  of  course,  found  in  older  dogs 
only,  and  will  do  for  all  breeds  except  very  small  toy  dogs,  when  half  a 
teapoonful   will    do: 

Spirit    chloroform    y2    dram 

Wine    of   ipecac    3   drams 

Tincture  of  squills 5  drams 

Simple   syrup 1   ounce 

Aqua    to    make 4   ounces 

There  are  a  great  many  other  good  cough  remedies,  in  fact  anything 
good  for  the  master's  cough  is  good  for  the  dog's,  and  I  herewith  give  sev- 
eral prescriptions  that  I  know  to  be  good  by  having  tried  them. 

A  dog  that  is  well  and  in  good  condition  may  have  a  dry  cough,  does 
not  cough  very  much  at  a  time,  but  quite  often.  I  have  cured  such  cases 
with  the  following: 


 

Carbonate  of  aninioniacum    3  drams 

Fluid  extract  of  belladonna 2  drams 

Gum    camphor    5  drams 

Syrup  of  squills '. 5  drams 

Simple   syrup    4  ounces 

Fluid  extract  of  licorice    4  ounces 

Dose   for  a  medium-sized   dog,   a  teaspoonful   every   four  hours.      This 
is  a  very  good  cough  syrup.     Large  dogs  could  have  1  y2  teaspoonsf ul. 

A  cough  remedy  advertised  for  humans,  called  "Pinex,"  I  tried  on  dogs, 
and  found  it  to  be  very  good  for  many  coughs.  You  can  get  a  fifty  cent 
bottle  of  Pinex  of  your  druggist,  and  from  this,  prepare  at  home,  a  pint 
of  cough  syrup  that  would  cost  a  couple  dollars,  by  mixing  the  contents 
of  the  bottle  in  a  syrup  you  can  easily  make  from  less  than  a  pound  of 
granulated  sugar.  The  dose  would  be  from  half  to  a  teaspoonful,  every 
two  to  four  hours.  Dogs  larger  than  fifty  pounds,  could  stand  a  little 
larger  dose.  I  have  used  this  for  the  cough  a  dog  has  in  distemper,  and 
it  did  the  dog's  cough  good,  not  conflicting  with  the  other  medicines 
being  used. 

"Very  lately  the  following  prescription  was  prescribed  for  me  by  a 
regular  doctor  for  a  chronic,  bronchial,  dry  cough,  that  one  of  my  old 
dogs  has  every  fall  and  winter,  which  nothing  I  had  ever  used  would  stop — 
this  one  did  it — and  I  consider  it  a  most  valuable  one. 

Syrup  Oocillaiia,  Compound  (Parke  Davis  &  Co.). — Dose  would  be  a 
teaspoonful  for  dogs  up  to  50  pounds,  and  a  little  more  for  very  large 
breeds,  every  two  or  three  hours.  A  dose  of  any  cough  syrup  should  al- 
ways be  given  the  last  thing  at  night. 

Here  is  an  "old  fashioned  cough  syrup"  for  a  "sore  throat  cough." 
Boil  down  some  onions  and  brown  sugar,  and  give  teaspoonful  every  twd 
or   three  hours. 

Another  very  sensible  article  on  coughs,  (which  I  found  some  place), 
commends   itself: 

"There  are  two  kinds  of  coughs  that  a  dog  suffers  from;  one  comes 
from  the  throat  and  the  other  from  the  stomach,  and  each  requires  dif- 
ferent treatment.  There  is  about  as  much  use  in  trying  to  cure  a  stomach 
cough  with  a  bronchial  remedy  as  there  would  be  for  you  to  take  a  laxa- 
tive for  chilblains,  and  yet  it  is  often  done.  The  bronchial  cold  may  be 
treated  in  the  following  manner:  Put  in  a  warm  room  and  give  either  cod 
liver  oil,  syrup  of  white  pine  or  some  similar  preparation.  A  good  formula 
for  coughs  in  dogs  is  syrup  of  squills,  syrup  of  wild  cherry,  of  each  two 
parts;  glycerine,  one  part.  If  the  cough  becomes  so  bad  that  there  is  a 
great  deal  of  difficulty  in  breathing,  an  ordinary  water  kettle  placed  over 
a  gas  stove  or  some  other  hot  fire,  so  that  the  escape  of  steam  will  be 
rapid,  will  be  found  to  be  a  relief.  Of  course,  a  regular  bronchitis  kettle 
or  one  of  the  patent  lamps  that  can  be  had  for  a  small  sum  at  any  drug 
store,  can  also  be  used.  In  the  stomachie  cough  it  is  always  wise  to  give 
a    purgative   and    to    treat    for    worms,    as    internal    parasites    are    in    nine 


 

cases  out  of  ten  the  primary  cause  of  the  trouble.  Two  or  three  days 
should  then  he  allowed  to  elapse,  and  the  treatment  repeated.  This  may 
be  done  a  third  and  even  a  fourth  time,  if  the  cough  does  not  disappear. 
Do  not  physic  every  day  or  you  will  weaken  the  animal  too  much,  but  allow 
two  or  three  days  to  pass." 

Cuts,  Tears  or  Wounds. — The  first  thing  to  be  done  is  to  stop  the 
bleeding,  which  can  generally  be  done  by  simple  pressure  with  the  fingers, 
or  by  a  few  folds  of  lint  pressed  firmly  against  the  cut.  Unless  a  consid- 
erable artery  has  been  severed,  these  means  are  generally  successful,  but  if 
such  is  the  case,  a  ligature  will  be  the  cure.  After  bleeding  is  partially  or 
entirely  stopped,  remove  all  foreign  bodies,  such  as  glass,  dirt,  thorns  or 
splinters,  but  avoid  using  very  cold  or  hot  water  in  doing  so,  having  it  about 
blood  warm.  If  the  cut  or  wound  is  superficial,  the  cleansing,  pressing 
of  the  parts  together  and  dressing  it  with  friars  balsam  or  tincture  of 
myrrh,  applied  with  a  small  brush  or  feather,  will  be  all  that  is  required, 
the  using  of  these  tinctures  leaving  on  the  wound  a  protective  covering 
of  gum.  If  the  lips  of  the  wound  will  not  meet,  draw  them  together  with 
a  few  stitches,  using  a  slightly  curved  suture  needle  and  a  silk  thread 
which  should  be  waxed  with  beeswax  to  prevent  absorption  and  its  acting 
as  a  seaton.  Sewing  up  wounds  is  easy.  Pass  needle  through  the  skin  on 
one  side  of  the  wound  from  the  outside  inward  and  then  through  the 
part  of  the  opposite  lip  from  the  inside  outward,  drawing  the  lips  gentlv 
together,  tie  the  thread  in  a  double  knot  and  cut  ends  off  close.  Do  each 
stitch  separately.  If  the  cut  is  a  long  one,  use  a.  pair  of  light  cross-forceps 
to  hold  the  lips  together  ahead  of  where  you  are  sewing,  as  a  neater  job 
can  be  made  in  so  doing.  The  stitches  should  be  about  a  half  an  inch 
apart  as  a  rule.  It  is  advisable  to  muzzle  the  dog  afterwards  or  keep  on  a 
light  bandage  to  keep  the  dog  from  biting  off  the  threads  and  undoing  the 
stitches  with  his  mouth  and.  tongue.  The  wound  heals  by  adhesion  or  gran- 
ulation matter  forming  and  great  attention  must  now  be  paid  to  keeping 
it  clean  so  as  to  prevent  purification  of  exuding  matter.  Constantly  wash 
away  all  discharge,  sponging  fr-eely  with 

Pure   carbolic   acid    %    ounce 

Glycerine    2  ounces 

With  water  to  make  a  quart.     Or  the  antiseptic  prescription  referred  to  be- 
low. 

In  slight  cuts  in  the  legs  or  feet,  all  that  is  necessary  is  to  wash  well 
and  apply  friars  balsam.  If  severe  and  requiring  bandaging,  apply  a  piece  of 
lint  under  the  bandage  saturated  with  a  mixture  of  friars  balsam  and 
camphorated   oil. 

The  above  is  Dalziel's   idea. 

Lately  I  have  in  such  cases  used  Peroxyde  of  Hydrogen,  or,  better  yet, 
applied  tincture  of  iodine  and  then  to  heal  it  up,  used  the  "Ungucntine" 
salve,  as  advised  in  Bites,  instead  of  the  above,  and  with  best  of  results* 


 

Either  Dalziel's  or  my  own  will,  however,  do.  In  applying  the  Peroxyde 
of  Hydrogen,  just  tip  the  bottle  up  against  the  wound  for  a  second,  when 
you  will  see  a  white  foaming  or  bubbling  discharge  come  from  the  sore. 
This  should  not  be  wiped  off  or  allowed  to  remain  on  for  over  a  minute 
or  so,  but  removed  then  by  a  little  water  squeezed  on  it  from  a  sponge  or 
cloth.  In  using  the  tincture  of  iodine,  apply  it  with  a  small  brush,  and 
after  it  has  dried,  then  rub  the  "Unguentine"  on,  once  or  twice  daily.  A 
good  idea  is  ,  to  always  keep  on  hand  a  small  vial  of  tincture  of  iodine, 
kept  tightly  corked.  Judgment  must  be  exercised  as  to  length  of  time  the 
wound  is  to  be  kept  open  and  dischorging,  the  Peroxyde  tending  to  close 
it  up,  as  will  the  tincture  of  iodine,  but  use  the  latter  on  wound  as  long 
as  there  is  any  bleeding,  once  a  day  generally  is  often  enough  for  this. 

Chorea. — Dalziel's  treatise  and  treatment  I  give  in  full,  for  it  is 
eminently  correct,  judging  by  my  own  experience.  It  is  a  hard  disease  to 
cure,  but  I  have  cured  young  dogs  one  or  two  years  old.  Read  what 
Dalziel  says,  and  if  you  have  a  dog  so  afflicted,  at  least  try  to  cure  it. 
I  never  admit  but  what  any  disease  can  be  cured,- or  helped,  and  I  try 
every  remedy  anyhow.  Sergeant's  Condition  Pills  have  cured  cases  in 
younger  dogs  for  me,  and  as  they  always  do  good  and  never  harm,  it  is 
worth  while  trying,  for  you  will  be  doing  your  dog  some  good  at  least. 
There  is  not  much,  if  any,  pain  in  chorea,  and  I  had  a  pug  bitch  three 
years  old  that  had  a  chronic  case  of  it,  but  yet  she  bred  and  raised  a 
healthy  litter  of  pups.  This  was  an  exception,  however,  as,  being  a  ner- 
vous trouble,  it  is  transmitable,  and  I  would  not  advise  using  either  a 
bitch  or  a  dog  for  breeding  purposes  that  was  so  afflicted.  It  is,  of  course, 
unpleasant  to  see  a  dog  constantly  twitching  or  jerking,  but  so  long  as  they 
do  not  suffer  I  think  it  my  duty  to  let  them  live. 

"This  most  distressing  complaint  arises  from  some  derangement  of 
the  nervous  system,  and  generally  exists  as  a  sequence  of  distemper,  when 
It  is  known  among  kennel  men  as  "the  twitch."  Chorea,  or  St.  Vitus'  dance, 
may,  however,  arise  from  other  causes,  producing  a  disturbing  effect  on  the 
nervous  system  such  as  a  severe  Injury  or  blow  on  the  head,  the  irrita- 
tion caused  by  worms,  or  long-continued  Impaired  digestion.  By  far  the 
most  common  cause,  however,  is  distemper,  the  brain  receiving  some  in- 
jury in  that  variety  of  the  disease  known  as  "Head  Distemper."  The  symp- 
tom Indicating  chorea  is  a  peculiar  Involuntary  convulsive  twitching  of 
the  muscles.  These  spasmodic  movements  or  jerklngs  may  be  either  par- 
tial or  general,  but  usually  partial.  One  or  both  hind  legs  are  affected, 
or  the  twitching  extends  to  the  muscles  of  the  fore  legs,  neck  and  shoul- 
ders, in  which  case  the  head  is  bobbed  up  and  down  in  a  silly,  helpless 
manner.  Sometimes  the  eyelids  and  muscles  of  the  face  are  affected,  but 
Whatever  part  of  the  body,  is  attacked  the  peculiar  twitching  or  jerking 
Is  always  unmistakable.  When  the  hind  quarters  are  the  seat  of  the 
disease  the  dog  will  sometimes  suddenly  drop  one  of  the  limbs  from  the 
hip  joint,  apparently  from  sudden  loss  of  power  or  command  over  the 
guiding  muscles.  The  weakness  is  strongly  shown  when  the  dog  attempts 
to  jump  onto  a  chair  or  the  lap,  which  he  fails  to  do,  and  generally  falls 
on  hte  side  "all  in  a  heap."  There  are  very  few  dogs  severely  afflicted  with 


r     •    -   

chorea  that  ever  get  completely  cured.  When  the  attack  is  but  slight  the 
dog  may  live  for  years  and  prove  a  useful  animal,  as,  except  in  severe 
cases,  it  does  not  seem  to  greatly  impair  the  general  health.  The  con- 
stant twitching  is,  however,  so  annoying  a  sight  to  most  people  that  few 
would  care  to  keep  a  dog  thus  afflicted.  Although  dogs  carefully  and 
properly  treated  in  distemper  are  less  likely  to  suffer  from  this  disease, 
yet  it  will  occasionally  occur  in  the  best  managed  kennels,  and  so  I  must 
proceed  to  consider  its  treatment.  The  first  thing  to  be  done  is  to  attend 
to  the  general  health,  and  especially  to  see  that  the  bowels  are  in  a  properly 
regulated  state;  and  it  is  better,  if  their  action  requires  correction,  to 
endeavor  to  accomplish  that  object  by  a  careful  regulation  of  diet,  rather 
than  by  a  resort  to  physic;  indeed,  all  through  chorea  the  food  must  be 
of  a  nature  easily  digested  and  given  with  regularity  if  any  course  of 
medicinal  treatment  is  to  be  successful.  The  remedies  recommended  in 
chorea  are  arsenic,  sulphate  of  zinc,  nitrate  of  silver  and  nux  vomica  and 
its  preparations.  Arsenic  I  do  not  recommend,  but  either  of  the  following 
may  be  tried,  and  it  is  sometimes  found  that  using  them  alternately  has 
a  more  beneficial  effect  than  a  perseverance  with  one  remedy  only.  Pills 
may  be  made  thus: 

Sulphate  of  Zinc.  Pills. 

Sulphate   of  zinc    2  4   grains 

Extract   of  gentian    18   grains 

Powdered  gum  acacia 18  grains 

Make  into  twelve  pills.  Dose  for  a  dog  30-lb.  to  50-lb.  weight,  one 
pill  twice  a  day.    Small  dogs  a  half  pill  as  a  dose. 

Nitrate  of  Silver  Pills. 

Nitrate  of  silver   3  grains 

Bread    2  drams 

Make  into  twenty-four  pills.  Dose  for  a  dog  30-lb.  to  50-lb.  weight,  one 
pill  twice  a  day  given  at  the  time  of  feeding.  Small  toy  dogs  of 
10  to  12  lbs.  give  one-half  a  pill  as  a  dose. 

The  following  pills  I  have  found  Very  successful,  and  can  Btrongly 
recommend  them,  although,  of  course,  they  a/e  not  infallible.  As  the 
ingredients  require  very  great  accuracy  in  weighing,  and  very  careful 
mixing,  this  must  be  left  to  a  properly  qualified  dispensing  chemist,  and 
the  box  containing  the  pills  should  be  kept  strictly  in  the  master's  pos- 
session, for  fear  of  accident: 

Strychnine    1  grain 

Quinine    18  grains 

Extract  of  belladonna 6  grains 

Extract  of  gentian    1   dram 

Powder  for  Compond  Rhubarb  Pill 1  dram 

Mix  very  carefully  and  divide  into  forty-eight  pills.     Dose  for  a  dpg 


 

20-lb.  to  40-lb.  weight,  one  pill  twice  a  day  with  his  food.     Small 
dogs,  half  a  pill.     St.  Bernards,  one  and  one-half  pills  as  a  dose. 

"It  is  necessary  in  chorea  to  continue  the  use  of  these  remedies  for  a 
considerable  time — at  least  a  month  or  two  months,  in  most  cases — to 
produce  any  satisfactory  result,  or  even  to  give  them  a  fair  trial;  and,  as 
before  said,  the  dog  must  be  carefully  fed,  well  lodged  and  properly  exer- 
cised when  he  has  sufficient  power  to  use  his  limps,  and  in  the  case  of  dogs 
reared  in  towns,  a  change  to  the  country  for  some  weeks  would  be  beneficial. 
Galvanism  has  been  recommended  for  chorea;  I  have  not  seen  it  tried,  but 
should  think  it  well  worth  a  trial." 

Here  are  two  different  cases  of  chorea  prescribed  for  by  the  American 
Field: 

"About  two  months  since  I  bred  a  young  pug  bitch,  and  shortly  after- 
ward I  noticed  a  nervous  affection  in  her  face;  just  about  as  regular  as 
a  clock  would  tick  the  lower  jaw  would  drop  and  raise  again,  and  for  a  while 
her  tongue  would  hang  out  at  one  side  as  if  partially  paralyzed.  "What  is 
the  probable  cause,  and  what  treatment  should  she  have?  She  did  not 
whelp,  and  this  was  her  first  mating.  Ans. — Chorea;  give  two  drops  of 
Fowler's  Solution  of  Arsenic  three  times  daily  for  six  consecutive  days,  then 
increase  the  dose  one  drop  daily  until  fifteen  drops  are  given  at  each  and 
every  dose;   continue  this  for  one  week,  then  decrease  in  the  same  raitio. 

"Please  prescribe  for  my  English  setter  bitch  that  has  had,  for  the 
last  two  months,  a  severe  jerking  in  her  fore  legs,  seeming  to  be  worse, 
in  damp  weather;  otherwise  she  is  apparently  in  good  health.  The  bitch 
had  the  distemper  about  two  or  three  months  ago.  Ans. — Chorea.  For 
ten  consecutive  days  give  ten  grains  of  iodide  of  potash  three  times  daily, 
then  give  six  drops  of  Fowler's  Solution  three  times  daily  for  seven  con- 
secutive days,  and  on  the  eighth  day  increase  the  dose  one  drop  daily 
until  thirty  drops  are  given  at  each  and  every  dose;  continue  this  for 
fourteen  days  then  decrease  in  the  same  raitio."  The  electric  battery  has 
proved  of  great  benefit  in  many  cases. 

The  two  above  cases  of  chorea  in  a  pug  and  an  English  setter  gives 

you  the  old  and  well-known  Fowlers'  Solution  of  Arsenic  treatment,  and 

prbper  sized  doses,  if  you  wish  to  try  it.     This  is  the  old-time  remedy  and 

has  cured  Chorea  when  directions  were  carefully  followed. 

■•.-., 

The  following  article  on  Chorea  was.  written  especially  for  .this', book 
by  Dent: 

"Chorea  is  the  most  distressing  nervous  complaint  dog  owners  are 
familiar  with.  It  is  due  to  an  involuntary  nervous  discharge  of  the  motor 
cells  controlling  certain  muscles.  The  essential  pathology  of  these  more 
or  less  constant  muscular  twitchings  has  baffled  all  scientific  investigation, 
and  careful  microscopic  autopsies,  extending  from  the  nerve  terminus  in  a 
muscle  back  to  the  cord  and  brain,  have  failed  to  reveal  a  lesion  that  can 
be  considered  a  cause. 

"The  most  satisfactory  theory  is  that  the  brain  cells  controlling  a 
certain  muscle  or  set  of  muscles  are  so  weakened  by  the  poison  of  distemper 
or  some  other  cause  as  to  cause  them  to  send  out  muscular  impulses  with- 
out natural  mental  impulse  or  will  power. 


. 

"There  is  a  form  of  chorea,  clue  to  a  disturbed  nervous  system,  induced 
by  blows  or  injuries  to  the,  or  the  presence  of  intestinal  parasites  which 
have  deranged  the,  digestive  organs.  This  form  of  chorea  is  generally 
curable.  The  form  which  follows  distemper  is  not  so  amenable  to  treat- 
ment. 

"The  symptoms  are  so  prominent  and  characteristic  that  there  is  no 
mistaking  the  disease,  and  the  peculiar  involuntary  twitching  of  the  muscles 
once  seen  is  never  forgotten.  Then  entire  body  may  be  affected;  generally 
it  is  only  one  set  of  muscles,  those  of  the  foreleg  or  of  the  neck  and  shoul- 
ders, in  which  case  the  head  bobs  up  and  down  in  a  most  helpless  manner. 
Where  the  hindlegs  are  affected  the  dog  will  suddenly  drop  one'  of  the  limbs 
from  the  hip  downward  as  if  there  was  an  entire  loss  of  strength  and 
power.  This  is  particularly  noticeable  if  it  attempts  to  jump  on  a  chair 
or  table,  for,  after  one  or  two  attempts,  it  falls  on  its  side  or  in  a  heap, 
completely  helpless. 

"The  top  of  the  head  is  often  affected  and  twitches  and  throbs  in  a 
most  peculiar  manner,  and  the  jerking  is  commonly  observable  about  the 
muscles  of  the  eyelids,  lips  and  face.  In  severe  cases  of  chorea  the  gen- 
eral health  is  affected,  and  the  animal  shows  signs  of  suffering  probably 
due  to  anxiety  and  appreciation  of  its  helpfulness.  In  mild  cases  it  does 
not  affect  the  animal's  general  health,  and  some  field  dogs  have  it  all 
their  lives  without  affecting  their  usefulness.  The  owner,  however, 
is  annoyed  by  the  constant  muscular  movements  and  is  always  anxious  to 
effect  a  cure.     Some  cases  are  quiet  during  sleep,  others  are  worse. 

"Treatment. — Although  the  disease  occurs  in  the  best  regulated  ken- 
nels, despite  the  most  careful  treatment  of  distemper,  it  does  not  alter  the 
fact  that  dogs  properly  treated  for  distemper  and  worms  and  well  housed 
and  fed  are  less  liable  to  the  disease  than  those  which  are  neglected. 

"The  first  thing  to  do  is  to  look  after  the  animal's  general  health. 
See  that  the  bowels  act  promptly  and  this  is  accomplished  best  by  dieting 
and  the  feeding  of  foods  possessing  laxative  properties  and  not  by  resorting 
to  physics.  If  there  is  the  slightest  suspicion  of  worms  treat  for  them, 
as  they  torment  the  nervous  system  beyond  all  measure  and  are  the  cause 
of  many  attacks. 

"Feed  regularly  and  carefully,  and  if  there  is  a  tendency  to  constipa- 
tion use  well  boiled  oatmeal.  Mutton  broths  with  stale  bread,  beef  well 
boiled  or  raw  lean  beef  chopped  fine.  From  two  to  five  grains  of  pepsin 
and  one-half  grain  of  diastase  can  be  given  after  each  meal,  to  assist  the 
stomach  in  the  process  of  digestion.  If  there  is  much  debility  and  weak- 
ness give  emulson  of  cod  liver  oil  in  doses  of  from  one  teaspoonful  to 
three  tablespoonfuls  three  or  four  times  a  day. 

"The  drugs  principally  used  are  mix  vomica  or  strychnine  and  arsenic. 
Some  practitioners  use  a  dose  of  nux  vomica  in  the  morning  and  arsenic  at 
night.  As  both  of  these  drugs  are  poisonous  they  must  be  used  with  care. 
The  dose  of  nux  vomica  is  from  two  to  twelve  drops  of  the  tincture  twice 
a  day.  It  is  a  valuable  vegetable,  bitter,  and  an  aid  to  digestion  as  well 
as  a  nerve  stimulant.  Any  stiffness  of  the  muscles  or  tendency  to  spasms 
is  an  indication  for  its  immediate  discontinuance. 

"Fowler's  Solution  of  Arsenic  is  the  most  convenient  form.     The  dose 


46  DISEASE3 

is  from  one  to  thirty  drops.  Give  a  drop  at  first,  increasing  it  one  drop 
a  day  up  to  the  larger  dose,  then  gradually  decreasing  and  discontinue 
for  a  time,  and  whenever  there  is  any  constitutional  symptoms  of  its  ef- 
fects, such  as  reddened  or  fullness  under  the  eye,  nausea,  whitish  tongue, 
etc. 

"The  following  pills  are  highly  recommended  by  many  who  have  used 
•them.  As  some  of  the  ingredients  are  poisonous,  they  should  be  prepar- 
ed by  a  qualified  druggist  or  pharmacy  graduate.  Strychnine  one  grain, 
extract  of  belladonna  six  grains,  extract  of  gentian  one  dram,  gipsin  three 
drams.  .  Mix  carefully  and  divide  into  forty-eight  pills,  one  of  which  is 
to  be  given  night  and  morning  in  the  patient's  food.  This  dose  is  for  a 
dog  weighing   from   thirty   to   fifty  pounds. 

"The  medicines  heretofore  mentioned  are,  in  their  action,  purely  alter- 
ative and  nerve  stimulating;  in  connection  with  them  may  be  mentioed 
the  use  of  the  electrical  current  from  a  surgeon's  battery.  Obstinate  and 
apparently  incurable  cases  sometimes  show  a  decided  improvement,  and 
radical  cures  are  effected,  in  response  to  a  gentle  stimulating  current  of 
electricity.  One  electrode  should  be  applied  to  the  neck  directly  over  the 
spinal  cord,  the  other  to  the  extremity  of  the  affected  leg,  and  the  electrical 
stimulation  continued  for  from  five  to  thirty  minutes  twice  a  day.  The 
beneficial  effects  from  a  careful  massage  of  the  leg  and  a  manipulation  of 
the  muscles  cannot  be  overestimated.  Besides  breaking  down  adhesions 
or  agglutinations  of  the  muscle  fibers,  it  increases  the  supply  of  blood  to 
the  part  and  promotes  its  nutrition  and  has  a  most  beneficial  reflex  action 
on   the-  entire   nervous   system." 

Cramp.— This  term  is  often  indiscriminately  applied  by  sportsmen 
to  spasm  from  whatever  cause;  but  cramp  of  the  limbs  from  exposure  to 
cold  and  wet  often  occurs,  and  it  will  quickly  yield  to  brisk  rubbing  and 
warmth.  If  nothing  else  is  handy,  rub  with  a  little  spirit  and  water  or  a 
rough  dry  cloth.  Dogs  used  in  hunting  or  retrieving  from  water  are  very 
liable  to  it,  the  hindquarters  being  most  frequently  affected,  and  in  such 
cases  a  good  brisk  liniment,  such  as  the  following,  should  be  carried  in  the 
boat: 

Stimulating  Liniment. — Compound  camphor  liniment,  3  oz.;  olive  oil, 
spirit  of  turpentine,  and  spirit  of  hartshorn,  of  each  1  oz.;  mix.  A  hot  bath 
is  also  very  effective,  especially  if  the  dog  is  afterward  gently  rubbed; 
care  must,  however,  be  taken  to  dry  the  animal  thoroughly. 

Crooked  Limbs. — See   Rickets. 

Cancer. — This  can  only  safely  be  treated  by  the  verterinary  surgeon. 
The  main  thing  for  the  dog's  owner  is  to  be  able  to  distinguish  between 
cancer  and  other  tumors.  The  safest  plan  is,  however,  not  to  take  any 
chance  by  delay,  but  on  suspicion  consult  the  veterinarian. 

Choking. — This  accident  is  not  uncommon  with  greedy  animals  that 
bolt  their  food;  a  bone,  a  piece  of  gristly  meat,  or  other  hard  substance, 
is  bolted,  and  sticks   fast  in  its  passage  to   the  stomach.      I  always  adopt 



the  plan  of  reserving  bones  until  after  the  clogs  have  fed,  for  if  given  with 
the  other  food  they  are  at  once  picked  out,  and  the  smaller  ones  are, 
when  the  dog  is  hungry,  apt  to  be  swallowed  unmasticated  and  produce 
choking. 

Treatment. — Frequently  by  manipulating  the  throat  outside  with  the 
fingers  the  obstruction  can  be  worked  down  the  gullet,  or  if  it  can  be  felt 
in  the  upper  part  of  the  throat,  it  may  be  removed  by  the  throat  forceps, 
which  most  veterinary  surgeons  keep  by  them.  Hill  recommends,  when  the 
substance  is  too  low  for  extraction,  and  manipulating  with  the  fingers 
externally  fails,  to  endeavor  gently  to  force  it  down  with  a  piece  of  bent 
whalebone,  having  a  piece  of  sponge  tied  to  the  end  of  it,  and  dipped  in 
oil.  In  using  this  extra  care  must  be  taken  that  the  sponge  is  so  firmly 
attached  to  the  whalebone  that  it  cannot  slip  off,  for  if  swallowed  it  might 
effectually  block  up  one  of  the  smaller  intestines;  therefore,  cut  nitches 
in  the  whalebone,  into  which- tie  the  piece  of  sponge.  As  soreness,  if  not 
actual  laceration,  is  almost  sure  to  be  caused,  the  dog  should  for  some 
days  after  be  confined  to  soft  food. 

The  following,  on  choking,  I  found.  The  subject  is  so  ably  treated, 
that   I   publish  it  also: 

"This  is  of  very  frequent  occurrence  with  dogs,  as  usually  they  are 
voracious  feeders,  careless  of  consequences,  and  the  fact  that  they  use 
their  mouths  much  as  we  do  our  hands  in  grasping  and  conveying  various 
objects  makes  them  particularly  liable  to  swallow  foreign  substances,  that 
may  become  lodged  in  the  gullet.  The  commonest  objects  on  which  dogs 
choke  are  bones  that  they  have  been  feeding  upon.  If  the  bone  lodges 
in  the  back  of  the  throat  it  may  set  up  such  a  violent  coughing  and 
retching  as  to  asphyxiate  the  subject.  The  back  of  the  throat,  however,  is 
not  the  usual  lodging  place,  for  as  a  rule  the  bone  or  other  object  passes 
that  point,  where  the  gullet  is  comparatively  large,  and  lodges  over  the 
heart,  where  it  is  smaller.  Locating  at  this  point  causes  the  greatest 
distress.  The  dog  keeps  gulping  as  if  trying  to  swallow,  and  from  time 
to  time  is  seized  with  a  period  of  retching.  In  a  day  or  two  the  extreme 
distress  passes,  and  the  patient  drinks  water  and  milk  or  other  liquids 
freely  and  can  also  swallow  raw  eggs,  but  if  solid  food  is  taken,  directly 
it  reaches  the  obstruction  it  lodges.  Young  dogs  and  those  which  are 
playful  sometimes  swallow  needles  and  pins.  These  usually  become 
imbedded  in  the  back  of  the  tongue,  and  can  be  removed  from  that  position, 
but  sometimes  they  reach  the  gullet  and  pass  through  into  the  tissues, 
forming  an  abscess,  their  usual  location  being  just  behind  the  angle  of 
the  jaw.  Removing  needles  and  pins  from  the  back  of  the  tongue  is  done 
most  easily  with  a  pair  of  forceps,  although  it  sometimes  can  be.  done  with 
the  finger.  The  principal  thing  is  to  be  careful  not  to  break  the  object. 
The  symptoms  in  these  cases  are  usually  very  severe,  so  that  prompt  action 
is  necessary.  In  those  cases  where  a  bone  has  pased  far  down  the  gullet- 
and  lodged  over  the  heart  it  is  sometimes  sufficient  to  feed  the  dog  a  few 
pieces  of  meat,  which  will  force  the  obstruction  on.  If  this  is  not  success- 
ful a  probang  must  be  uesd  to  force  the  obstruction  down  into  the  stom- 
ach, but  this  should  be  attempted  only  by  a  skillful  veterinarian  or  a 
physician,   as  it  may  be  necessary  to  use  considerable   force,   and   there  is 




danger  of  rupturing  the  gullet,,  which,  is  fatal.  If  the  obstruction  cannot 
be  removed  by  the  probang,  then  the  only  thing  remaining  is  to  feed 
the  patient  on  liquid  food  until  such  time  as  the  sharp  points  of  the  bone 
become  dissolved  and  rounded  off,  so  that  it  will  be  easily  pushed  along 
by  the  probang."  _ 

CHLOROFORMING  DOGS  FOR  AN  OPERATION. 

If  it  is  really  necessary  to  do  this,  then  have  a  careful  anethetist  who 
understands  his  subject,  do  the  work.  A  quarter  of  an  hour  is  long  enough 
for  a  dog  to  be  kept  under  the  influence,  and  should  be  ample  time  for  any 
operation.  Chloroform  is  dangerous,  at  best,  with  any  dogs,  and  with  some 
breeds,  Chow  Chows  for  instance,  it  is  sure  to  mean  a  dead  dog.  Anyone 
who  has  had  experience  in  the  destruction  of  dogs  with  chloroform,  knows 
how  quickly  they  succumb  to  it.  Ether  is  a  safer  anesthetic,  which  can 
be  used  with  as  much  success  and   far  less   risk. 

If  an  anesthetic  has  to  be  given,  ask  the  operating  surgeon  to  use 
ether.  The  bet  way  to  give  an  anesthetic:  put  on  a  wire  cage  muzzle, 
having  first  secured  dog  so  he  cannot  struggle.  Around  the  muzzle  an 
ordinary  piece  of  surgeon's  list  can  be  placed,  and  on  this  the  anesthetic. 

For  many  minor  operations,  liquid  cocaine  can  be  used  instead,  the 
dog  strapped  down,  and  his  owner  also  hold  and  control  his  dog.  I  have 
done  this  without  the  strapping  even,  talked  to  the  dog,  he  understood  me, 
and  stood  the  pain.  This  was  the  removal  of  a  cyst  on  a  Pug  dog,  behind 
his  ear,  the  size  of  a  lemon.     Cocaine  was  used. 

Coryza. — See   Catarrh. 

Costiveness. — See  Constipation. 

Caked  Breast. — This  is  generally  caused  by  milk  fever,  a  too  plentiful 
supply  of  milk  which  is  not  nursed  sufficiently  from  the  dam  by  a  small 
litter,  or  will  happen  in  cases  of  the  bitch  loosing  her  puppies.  She  must 
be  milked  three  times  daily  by  hand  (this  done  gently  on  teats  that  are 
hard  and  caked)  for  a  few  days,  gradually  getting  down  to  twice,  and  then 
once  a  day,  stopping  as  the  flow  of  milk  gets  less. 

Also  use  quite  often,  every  two  hours  or  so,  camphorated  oil  or  gum 
camphor  and  lard  melted  together  (which  should  be  kept  in  a  corked 
jar),  rubbing  this  in  well  on  all  the  teats.  This  will  dry  up  the  milk, 
soften  up  the  caked  breasts  and  dry  up  the  hanging  down  bag  as  well, 
making  the  bitch  more  sightly  looking.  A  solution  of  camphor,  tannin 
and  glycerine,  which  any  druggist  can  put  up  for  you,  is  the  very  best 
thing  to  use  alone  for  drying  up  the  bags  of  a  bitch  after  she  has  weaned 
her  puppies. 

Dent  prescribed  for  following  case: 

"My  English  setter  bitch,  six  years  old,  whelped  and  had  a  caked 
udder  but  seemed  to  get  over  it.  Now  one  of  the  front  teats  shows  a 
lump   or   cake   as   large   as   an   English   walnut.      What   treatment   do   you 


 

advise  and  what  is  it?  Ans. — It  is  simply  caked.  Give  five  grains  of  the 
iodide  of  potash  three  times  a  day  for  two  weeks  and  apply  with  gentle 
friction  to  the  enlarged  teat  the  following  ointment:  Belladonna  extract 
twenty  grains,  gum  camphor  twenty  grains,  lanolin  one  ounce.  She  can  he 
bred  safely  when  she  comes  in   season." 

Claws,  Overgrown — Toy  dogs  and  house  pets  which  have  little  or  no 
exercise  out  of  doors,  where  they  can  dig  and  scrape  the  ground,  and  so 
wear  the  claws  down,  suffer  from  an  overgrowth  of  them.  The  nail  curls 
round,  and,  if  not  cut  in  time,  it  grows  into  the  sole  of  the  foot,  causing 
soreness  and  lameness.  The  ends  of  the  claws  should  be  cut  off  with 
a  pair  of  sharp,  strong  nippers,  or  nail  clippers,  such  as  one  can  buy  at 
any  cutler's  for  7  5  cents.  Puppies'  toe  nails,  especially  of  those  running 
on  grass  or  on  boards  in  winter,  grow  long  and  tend  to  spread  the  toes 
open,  when  the  latter  should  be  compact.  Extreme  care  should  be  ob- 
served that  only  the  dead  white  or  light  colored  nails  is  cut  off,  and  when 
the  nail  is  dark,  judgment  must  be  exercised.  It  is  best  to  clip  little 
and  often,  and  especially  so  if  the  nail  has  a  tendency  to  grow  in. 

In  cases  which  have  been  neglected,  the  process  of  removal  should 
be  gradual,  a  small  portion  being  taken  off  every  few  days  or  so  until 
the  claws  are  of  the  normal  length.  If  the  sole  or  flesh  has  been  pene- 
trated, it  will  most  likely  fester,  and  should  be  freely  bathed  in  warm 
water,  and  the  "Unguentine"  salve  used  to  heal.

Clipping  Toe  Nails. — See  Overgrown  Claws. 

Callosities. — Bare  callous  places  on  the  dog  from  rubbing,  chafing 
or  lying  on  bare  boards.  Large  dogs  are  very  often  so  troubled.  Glycerine 
or  vaseline  is  used  quite  often,  and  keep  treatment  up  for  some  time,  either 
of  which  will  soften  and  tend  to  remove  these  lumps.  They  do  no  harm 
but  detract  from  the  appearance  of  the  dog.  Eberhart's  skin  remedy  will,  in 
due  time,  fix  them  up,  but  should  be  well  rubbed  in,  twice  daily. 

Catarrh Dogs  that  are   badly  kenneled,   exposed   to  cold  winds,   and 

those  that  have  lately  had  distemper,  or  a  severe  cold,  are  subject  to  an 
inflammation  of  the  membranes  of  the  nostrils  and  air  passages,  and  a  more 
or  less  thick  discharge  of  muco  purulent  matter  from  the  nose,  constitut- 
ing what  is  commonly  known  as  catarrh.  The  disease  is  "disgusting  and 
annoying  in  the  extreme,  and  has  a  very  debilitating  effect  upon  the 
patients  general  health.  The  eyes  become  affected,  and  if  the  disease  is  not 
promptly  treated,  the  inflammation  spreads  to  the  bones  of  the  head,  the 
discharge  unendurably  offensive,  and  the  breathing  is  seriously  interferred 
with.     The  longer  the  disease   is  neglected  the  worse  it  becomes. 

Treatment. — Remove  all  discharge  from  the  nostrils  by  frequent  bath- 
ing with  a  saturated  solution  of  boracic  acid,  as  the  discharge  irritates  the 
external  parts  and  is  liable  to  cause  Eczema.   With  a  small  syringe  a  small 


 

quantity  of  the  following  solution  shouid  be  injected  into  the  nostrils  three 
times  daily: 

Sulphate  of  zinc ■ 8  grains 

Boracic  acid    30  grains 

Glycerine     1  ounce 

Water    1  ounce 

An  ordinary  atomizer  or  spray  can  be  used  to  good  advantage  several 
times  a  day,  using  either  listerine  or  a  spray  after  the  following  formula: 

Sodal  biborat 1   dram. 

Sodal    carb 1   dram 

Acid   carbolic    6   grains 

Sulp.   of   zinc    1°   grains 

Sulp.  of  morphine .' 10   grains 

Glycerine     , 1   ounce 

Distilled    water    8   ounces 

Keep  dog  in  warm,  comfortable  quarters  and  pay  particular  attention 
to  his  diet.  If  there  is  any  tendency  to  scantiness  of  urine,  or  costiveness, 
give  30  drops  of  cascara  sagrada  in  a  teaspoonful  of  olive  oil.  Feed  any- 
thing he  will  eat  and  give  a  tablespoonful  of  cod  liver  oil  emulsion,  (small 
toys  of  course  less),  or  Fellows'  Syrup  of  Hyphophosphites  four  times  a 
day,  containing  in  addition,  20  drops  of  the  Syrup  of  Iodide  of  Iron.  If 
there  is  much  discharge  from  the  eyes  wash  them  several  times  daily  with 
a   saturated  solution   of  boracic  acid. 

Chronic  Catarrh  of  Uterus. — This  sometimes  occurs  in  bitches,  just 
why  is  hard  to  say.  Such  bitches  are  not  liable  to  breed.  They  come  in 
season  same  as  others,  but  the  discharge  at  such  times  is  white,  really 
the  same  discharge  they  have  had  right  along,  only  not  noticed  perhaps. 
Treatment  would  depend  on  cause  of  the  catarrh,  and  for  which,  refer 
to   "Catarrh."

Catarrh,  or  Cold  in  the  Head.— Dogs  that  live  in  freedom,  although 
exposed  to  changes  of  temperature  and  weather,  are  not  so  liable  to  attacks 
of  catarrh  as  are  those  more  delicately  reared,  in  whom  a  sudden  change 
from  the  close  atmosphere  of  the  room  to  the  open  air,  or  exposure  to  a 
shower  of  rain,  frequently  will  produce  a  cold.  First  symptoms  are  shiv- 
ering and  evident  languor,  succeeded  by  a  hot,  dry  nose,  with  a  thin  dis- 
charge at  first,  but  which  gradually  thickens.  If  the  disease  proceed, 
a  hot  skin,  dullness  about  the  eyes,  with  other  evidence  of  fever,  follow, 
according  to  the  severity  of  the  case.  There  is  more  or  less  discharge 
from  the  nose,  sometimes  accompanied  with  sneezing;  and  if  severe,  and 
the  bronchial  tubes  affected,  a  cough  will  be  the  result.  It' is  pretty  well 
understood,   when  applied   to   ourselves,   that  a   cold  uncared   for,   is  most 


 

likely  to  lead  to  serious  illness;  and  it  is  no  less  true  of  the  dog.  (See 
also  Ozaena).  In  puppies  the  symptoms  of  common  cold  may  be  mis- 
taken for  those  of  distemper;  and  in  older  dogs,  if  unchecked  and  uncared 
for,  it  is  likely  to  lead  to  bronchitis,  inflammation  of  the  lungs,  or  other 
dangerous  disease.  It  is,  therefore,  very  necessary  to  pay  attention  to 
the  first  appearance  of  a  deviation  from  health  in  this  direction,  mindful 
of  the  old  proverb — "A  stitch  in  time  saves  nine." 

A  coat  placed  on  the  dog,  as  previously  advised  under  Bronchitis. 
Some  hardy  animals  will  need  no  further  care  than  an  extra  warm  bed, 
and  a  warm  supper;  but  others  will  require  more  attention. 

If  conjointly  with  other  symptoms  mentioned,  there  is  a  scantiness 
of  urine,  and  costive  bowels,  give  a  dose  of  aperient  medicine,  follow- 
ed by  a  few  doses  of  the  Fever  Mixture: 

Powdered    Nitre    .' 1   dram 

Sweet  Spirits  of  Nitre   •  Vz    ounce 

Mindererous  Spirit   %    ounce 

Wine   of  antimony    1   dram 

Water    4  ounces 

Dose  for  20  to  50  pound  dog,  one  tablespoonful  every  four  hours  in 
a  little  gruel.  Smaller,  or  younger  dogs,  a  teaspoonful  to  a  de- 
sertspoonful. 

Remove  any  discharge  from  the  eyes  with  warm  water.  If  they  are  in- 
flamed, bathe  with  the  following  lotion:  Boracic  acid,  powdered,  1  scr. ; 
distilled  water,  6  oz.  To  allow  the  dog  to  breathe  freely,  the  nose  must 
be  bathed,  which  will  tend  to  prevent  accumulation  of  mucus.  During  con-, 
valesence  the  following  is  useful:  Easton's  Syrup  %oz.,  water  to  6  ounces. 
Dose,  a  desertspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  twice  a  day  after  food.  Here 
is  where,  in  place  of  this,  I  would  use  Eberhart's  Tonic  Pill.  Unless  the 
cold  has  engendered  some  more  dangerous  complaint,  this  treatment  will 
be  all  that  is  required.  If  the  cough  be  severe,  use  some  cough  remedy. 
See  Cough. 

Calculi. — The  dog  is  more  frequently  the  subject  of  Calculi  (stone), 
than  is  generally  supposed.  Their  locality  varies;  may  exist  in  the  biliary 
ducts,  the  bladder,  the  kidneys,  or  in  the  urethra  (the  passage  of  the  penis). 
In  Biliary  Calculi,  those  stones  situated  in  the  biliary  ducts,  providing 
they  are  sufficiently  small  to  pass  the  duct,  are  not  of  great  moment — in 
fact,  upin  post  mortem  their  existence  has  often  been  discovered,  while 
during  life  po  pain  or  inconvenience  was  noticed,  but  should  these  stones 
be  too  large  to  pass  the  ducts,  they  are  very  painful  and  a  most  fruitful 
cause  of  jaundice.  The  bile,  which  in  health  passes  through  these  ducts, 
becomes  completely  impeded  in  its  progress,  and  is  re-absorbed  by  the 
blood  vessels  entering  the  general  system,  and  jaundice  is  established. 
The  symptoms  of  biliary  calculi,  when  not  completly  blocking  the  ducts, 
are  excessive  sickness  and  constipation,  with  pain  in  the  abdomen.  The 
treatment  should   consist   in   allaying   the   pain,    when   the   stone   will   fre- 




quently  pass  in  a  natural  way.  For  this  give  5  to  30  drops  tincture  of 
opium  every  four  hours,  in  a  little  water,  and  a  soap  and  water  enema 
night  and  morning  to  relieve  the  bowels,  opium  having  a  tendency  to  con- 
stipate. 

Cystic  Calculi  is  stone  found  in  the  bladder.  It  is  supposed  that 
their  existence  is  rare,  but  such  is  not  the  case.  A  single  large  stone  is 
not  frequently  seen,  but  a  number  of  small  ones,  especially  in  old  dogs, 
is  not  at  all  uncommon.  In  the  former  case,  nothing  short  of  an  opera- 
tion can  possibly  effect  a  cure;  but  when  one  takes  into  consideration  the 
necessity  of  keeping  a  patient  in  one  position  after  the  operation  it  will 
be  patent  to  most  that  in  canine  practice  the  removal  of  the  stone  is 
seldom,  if  ever,  attended  with  success.  Small  calculi  will  frequently  pass 
from  the  bladder  into  the  urinary  passages,  and  if  small  enough,  out  of 
the  body,  through  the  penis;  but  often  these  stones  will  become  fixed  in 
the  urethra  and  the  dog  is  unable  to  pass  its  water.  The  bladder  be- 
comes distended,  and  if  not  relieved,  rupture  of  the  organ  results.  When 
you  find  a  dog  cannot  pass  its  water,  get  a  catheter,  rub  a  little  olive  oil 
or  vaseline  upon  it,  and  the  instrument  inserted  at  the  tip  of  the  penis.  Of 
course,  the  dog  must  be  placed  on  its  back.  Insert  the  catheter  very 
gently,  and  gradually  pass  it  into  the  bladder.  If  there  is  a  small  calculus 
in  the  urethra  the  passage  of  the  catheter  will  be  obstructed,  and  while 
this  is  so,  no  extreme  force  must  be  used,  or  a  very  extensive  injury  may 
result.  A  little  gentle  and  prolonged  pressure  may  return  the  stone  into 
the  bladder,  and  so  allow  the  urine  to  pass.  If  the  stone  cannot  be  re- 
turned in  this  attempt,  inject  into  the  passage  of  the  penis,  a  little  olive 
oil,  and  repeat  the  operation  with  the  catheter.  Calculi  sometimes  exist  in 
the  kidneys  and  may  pass  into  the  bladder,  thence  through  the  urinary 
passage,  and  so  out  of  the  body;  but  at  other  times  they  become  too  large 
to  leave  the  organ,  causing  intense  pain  and  subsequent  death.  The  symp- 
toms are  first,  stiffness  across  the  loins,  accompanied  by  pain  when  an 
attempt  is  made  to  move;  the  urine  is  passed  in  small  quantities,  and  is 
frequently — indeed  often — tinged  with  blood.  In  such  cases  it  is  a  matter 
of  relieving  the  pain,  with  the  hope  that  the  stone  is  small  enough  to  gain 
an  exit  by  the  penis.  To  relieve  the  pain  give  5  to  30  drops  of  tincture 
of  opium,  about  every  four  hours,  and  apply  hot  flannels  to  the  loins.  A 
dose  of  oil  to  relieve  the  bowels  is  beneficial,  as  any  straining  in  passing 
the  faeces  would  increase  the  pain.  It  is  best  to  leave  these  cases  to  the 
veterinarian. 

Dew  Claws. — Darwin  describes  as  "accidental  monstrosities,"  yet  a  gen- 
eral opinion  prevails  that  dew  claws  are  the  peculiar  inheritance  of  a  few 
breeds  of  dogs,  and  from  this  false  idea  possession  or  non-possession  of 
these  now  utterly  useles,  clumy  and  ugly  appendange  has  been  set  up 
as  a  test  of  purity  or  impurity  of  breeding  in  specimens  of  the  variety 
of  which  they  are  wrongly  ascribed  as  being  the  peculiar  property.  The 
dew  claw  is  attached  to  a  rudiment,  more  or  less  developed,  of  an  addi- 
tamentary  phalange  or  toe  situated  on  the  inner  side,  one  to  each  foot,  dis- 
tant from  and  considerably  above  the  other  toes. 




These  additional  toes  are  frequently  unattached  to  any  corresponding 
metacarpal  or  metatarsal  bone,  having  only  a  ligamentary  union,  so  that 
the  term  is  equally  applicable  to  the  extra  toe  often  seen  on  the  foreleg; 
and,  as  they  are  neither  useful  nor  ornamental,  I  would  in  all  cases  have 
them  removed,  being  only  a  disfigurement  in  any  breed.  This  should  be 
done  when  the  pups  are  with  the  dam,  as  she  will  take  care  of  the  wound 
and  heal  it  up  by  licking  it;  and  this  can  be  easily  done  with  a  pair  of 
strong  scissors.  If  left  till  the  dog  is  older,  they  are  liable  to  bleed  a  good 
deal,  and  the  pain,  of  course,  is  greater;  in  such  case,  the  wound  produced 
by  the  excision  should  be  at  once  well  saturated  with  frairs'  balsam.  If 
it  is  thought  well  to  remove  the  nail  only,  that  can  be  done  by  pulling  it 
out  with  a  pair  of  nippers. 

DESTRUCTION  OF  DOGS. 

"It  is  often  necessary  to  destroy  dogs  that  have  become  so  crippled  or 
injured  as  to  make  cure  very  doubtful;  and  in  most  litters  of  puppies 
there  are  some  so  puny  or  so  wanting  in  the  characteristics  of  the  breed 
that  they  ought  not  to  be  reared.  In  the  latter  case  it  is  most  humane  to 
destroy  such  as  are  not  wanted  as  soon  after  they  are  born  as  possible;  but 
even  when  a  mesalliance  has  taken  place,  one  at  least  of  the  puppies  should 
be  left  with  the  dam,  unless  one  or  more  foster  pups  of  pure  blood  can 
be  substituted. 

For  destroying  young  puppies  there  is  no  more  convenient  or  less 
painful  method  than  drowning;  while  for  mature  dogs  a  teaspoonful  of 
Scheele's  prussic  acid  will  cause  instantaneous  death.  In  giving  it,  the 
mouth  of  the  dog  should  be  held  open  and  upwards,  and  the  acid  poured 
well  back  on  the  tongue.  The  very  greatest  care  is,  however,  necessary 
in  dealing  with  a  drug  of  such  potency;  and  it  would  be  highly  dangerous 
to  life  if  any  of  it  were"  spilled  over  a  cut  or  wound." 

The  above  was  written  I  think,  by  F.  J.  Skinner,  as  I  got  it  from  Field 
and  Fancy,  and  give  it  as  good  advise.  I  bave  used  the  prussic  acid  in 
cases  of  an  old  and  helpless  dog,  that  had  to  be  put  out  of  the  way,  and 
it  worked  very  quickly,  as  its  action  goes  direct  to  the  heart,  the  pain  so 
short,  that  it  seems  to  be  humane.  Lately  I  have  cloroformed  several, 
and  rather  favor  the  chloroform  route.  I  lay  the  dog  down  on  its  side,  my 
right  hand  under  a  piece  of  carpet  on  which  is  some  cotton  in  the  center, 
and  have  an  assistant  pour  on  this  cotton  the  chloroform,  and  I  then  quickly 
apply  this  to  the  nose  of  the  dog,  the  cotton,  and  quickly  pull  the  carpet 
around  the  head  to  neck,  holding  it  there  so  no  air  can  get  in,  the  assis- 
tant meanwhile  holding  the  back  part  and  legs  of  dog.  The  dog  will  gen- 
erally resist  the  fumes  of  the  chloroform,  but  only  for  a  few  seconds,  and 
in  about  a  minute  he  will  be  dead,  providing  he  has  not  gotten  the  carpet 
loose,  and  some  air  thereby. 

Drowning  is  as  painless  as  any  death  can  be,  especially  for  puppies. 
I  get  a  pail,  fill  it  partly  full  of  water,  bave  a  pan  that  fits  the  top  of  the 
pail,  put  puppies  in,  the  pan  on  quickly,  and  on  top  of  the  pan  a  rock  or 
lump  of  coal,  heavy  enough  to  hold  pan  down,  and  then  I  go  away. 

Debility   and  Wasting. — It  happens   sometimes   that  a   dog   gradually 


 

V 

becomes  weak  and  wasting  in  flesh,  and  you  haven't  found  the  cause.  In 
such  cases  Eberhart's  Tonic  Pills  are  just  what  the  dog  should  have  for 
a  few  weeks,  as  they  can  do  no  harm,  but  will  do  great  good  in  building  a 
run  down  dog  up,  create  an  appetite  and  work  on  all  the  organs,  invigorat- 
ing the  system.  They  are  different  from  other  condition  pills,  as  they 
contain  no  arsenic  or  "dope"  of  any  kind.  Add  to  the  dogs  diet  for 
a  few  days,  some  raw,  lean  beef  cut  up  fine,  sprinkled  with  a  little  pepsin, 
once  a  day.  Also  look  for  any  symptoms  of  divergence  from  health  which 
may  indicate  the  cause  of  the  trouble. 

Docking  Tails — While  this  is  not  a  disease,  yet  it  happens  frequently 
that  puppies  suffer  not  a  little  from  this  being  clumsily  done.  It  is  not  a 
painful  operation  if  properly  done  and  before  puppy  is  weaned.  Fox  ter- 
riers, poodles  and  a  few  other  breeds  should  have  their  tails  docked  to 
conform  to  present  bench  show  requirements.  An  old  superstition  exists 
with  some  people  yet  that  a  tail  must  be  bitten  off,  which  is  simply  erron- 
eous and  disgusting.  Never  use  a  shears  or  scissors  as  the  pinching  before 
the  cut  would  cause  more  pain  than  the  cutting.  Before  you  are  ready  to 
cut  the  tail  get  an  ounce  of  tincture  of  iron.  .Have  a  solid  block  or  table, 
have  an  assistant  hold  the  puppy  up  to  it  with  its  tail  laid  on  the  block; 
calculate  how  long  or  short  a  tail  you  want  (three  inches  is  about  right), 
then  let  assistant  hold  puppy  up  to  table  with  tail  lying  on  it;  have  a  sharp 
butcher  knife  ready,  and  with  one  quick  and  rapid  cut  the  tail  is  off.  Tip 
your  bottle  of  tincture  of  iron  up  to  and  against  the  end  of  tail  and  drop 
your  pup  down  in  the  yard.  I  have  docked  the  tails  of  a  litter  of  poodle 
pups  when  not  one  of  them  gave  a  cry  or  yelp  from  the  operation,  but 
did  not  seem  to  notice  it  at  all  and  went  on  playing  as  usual  as  if  nothing 
had  occurred.  The  mother  will  lick  and  take  care  of  the  tails,  and  they 
will  heal  up  in  due  time.  Pull  the  skin  back  with  your  left  hand  when 
you  are  ready  to  do  the  cutting. 

Dysentery. — This  is  a  more  dangerous  disease  than  diarrhea,  which, 
when  protracted,  sometimes  causes  it,  and  may  be  described  as  diarrhea 
in  its  most  aggravated  form;  there  is  generally  feverishness  present,  con- 
siderable pain,  and  the  evacuations  are  often  black  in  color  and  very  offen- 
sive, and  followed  by  discharge  of  a  gelationous-like  substance  mixed  with 
blood.  The  loss  of  strength  is  very  rapid,  and  the  dog  must  be  supported 
by  drenching  with  beef  tea  and  a  little  port  wine  in  it,  the  medicine  and 
general  treatment  being  the  same  as  in  diarrhea.  In  one  case  of  this  kind, 
in  a  retriever,  I  gave  two  doses  of  twenty  drops  of  chlorodyne  with  very 
good  effect.  The  discharges  in  dysentery  are  immediately  caused  by  in- 
flammation of  the  mucous  membrane  lining  in  intestines,  and  are  distin- 
guished from  diarrhea  by  containing  no  fecal  matter  except  occasionally 
wTaen  it  is  voided  in  lumps;  but  the  ordinary  evacuations  in  dysentery, 
although  they  vary  in  appearance,  are  generally  slimy  looking  and  com- 
posed of  mucus  mixed  with  blood,  and  in  the  advanced  stages  of  the 
disease  pus  is  discharged  and  shreds  of  the  mucus  membrane,  very  offen- 
sive in  character.     The  disease  is  very  weakening,  causes  great  pain  and 




straining,   and    is   very   difficult   to   manage;    it   often    occurs   in    protracted 
cases  of  distemper,  and  carries  off  the  patient. 

In  treating  dysentery  the  "anodyne  mixture"  given  in  diarrhea  treat- 
ment should  be  tried  in  the  first  instance  alone,  and  if  ineffectual,  one  of 
the  following  pills  for  a  dog  of  60-lb.  to  SO-lb.,  every  four  hours  may  be 
tried  with  good  results.     For  smaller  dogs  half  a  pill. 

Pills  for  Dysentery. 

Take  of  tannic  acid  2  scruples  and  pure  sulphate  of  copper  1  dram, 
powdered  opium  20  grains,  mixed,  and  divide  into  twenty  pills;  or  if  a 
liquid  medicine  should  be  preferred,  the  following  will  answer:  Take  of 
pure  sulphate  of  copper  48  grains,  dissolve  in  2  ounces  of  cinnamon  wa- 
ter; add  V2  ounce  of  tincture  of  catechu,  y2  ounce  of  laudanum,  6  drams  of 
aromatic  spirits  of  ammonia,  and  make  up  to  12  ounces  with  cinnamon 
water.  Dose  for  an  80-lb.  dog  two  tablespoonfuls  every  four  hours;  smaller 
dogs  in  proportion.  Clysters  of  starch,  with  one  dram  of  laudanum  in  each, 
are  often  very  beneficial,  and  one  may  be  thrown  up  every  four  or  five 
hours. 

The  patient  should  have  perfect  rest,  all  evacuations  should  be  in- 
stantly removed,  and  the  place  where  the  patient  is  (which  should  be  warm 
but  airy)  kept  sweet  with  disinfectants.  The  food  should  consist  of  pearl 
barley,  rice,  arrowroot  or  wheaten  flour,  boiled  in  milk,  varied  with  strong 
beef  tea  slightly  thickened  with  stale  bread  or  plain  biscuit. 

I  have  cured  dogs  of  dysentery  of  long  standing,  obstinate  cases,  with 
the  following  prescription,  which  was  found  to  be  very  valuable  in  the 
treatment  of  such  cases  in  the  human  race — of  soldiers  who  contracted  this 
disease  in  the  war  of  '61.  A  friend  of  mine,  a  noted  doctor  in  human  prac- 
tice, gave  it  to  me  and  I  "tried  it  on  a  dog,"  succeeding  in  effecting  a  per- 
manent cure,  since  which  time  I  have  used  it  in  several  such  cases  with 
success.  Take  sima  ruba  bark,  two  ounces,  and  put  it  in  a  quart  of  water, 
boil  this  down  to  a  pint,  then  strain  and  boil  this  down  to  half  a  pint. 
(Be  careful  to  not  burn.)  The  dose  for  a  dog  the  size  of  a  pointer  would 
be  a  teaspoonful  three  times  a.  day.  Large  dogs  like  a  St.  Bernard,  two 
teaspoonfuls  at  a  dose,  while  very  small  toy  dogs  like  a  toy  terrier,  should 
have  half  a  teaspoonful  at  a  time. 

The  following  prescription  was  furnished  me  by  Mr.  J.  A.  Rogers,  of 
Ironton,  Ohio,  after  trying  it  on  his  pointer  that  had  suffered  with  chronic 
dysentery  for  over  a  month  till  the  dog  was  a  skeleton  and  could  hardly 
stand  up.  This  dog  had  been  treated  for  worms,  at  first  supposed  to  be 
the  cause  of  the  trouble,  and  several  well-known  remedies  tried,  but  no 
worms  and  no  stoppage  of  the  dysentery.  As  a  last  resort  he  tried  this 
prescription,  and  cured  the  dog.  From  a  full  history  of  this  extreme  case, 
furnished  me  by  several  letters  during  its  duration,  I  have  concluded  that 
this  is  a  very  valuable  remedy  and  likely  to  cure  when  everything  else  fails: 

Specific  aconite    10   drops 

Specific    baptisia 10   drops 

Specific    ipecac    15   drops 

Specific  ecefolta    " 1  dram- 

Glycerine    •  •  •  .      4  drams 

Add  water   (distilled)   to  make   8   ounces 

Of  the  first  four  articles  use  only  Lloyd  Bros.'  preparations — a  Cincinnati 
wholesale  drug  firm.  If  your  druggist  doesn't  have  them  in  stock,  he  can 
get  them  by  ordering  from  Lloyd  Bros.',  or  I  can  get  this  prescription 
filled  and  send  you.  The  dose  would  be  at  first — until  you  see  a  change 
for  the  better — a  teaspoonful  every  hour  until  three  or  four  doses  are  given, 
then  every  two  hours.  Of  course,  if  the  patient  should  be  a  very  young 
puppy,  the  dose  should  be  smaller,  but  such  cases  of  dysentery  are  seldom 
found  in  puppies,  except  when  a  very  great  looseness  of  the  bowels  appears, 
generally  due  to  worms;  such  cases  very  likely  will  be  cured  by  proper 
worm  treatment,  which  find  under  heading  of  Worms.  In  above  pre- 
scription the  ecefolta  is  most  excellent  for  the  blood,  blood-poisoning  and 
as  a  disinfectant  to  kill  germs,  and  to  reduce  fever,  which  every  dog  has 
in  a  case  of  dysentery.  Dog  also  has  a  cold  which  the  aconite  will  relieve. 
The  baptisia  is  for  fever  and  the  blood,  the  ipecac  for  the  stomach  and 
mucous  membrane  of  the  stomach  and  bowels.  I  will  add  here  that  this 
remedy  was  intended  by  the  regular  doctor,  who  prescribed  it  for  this  dog 
— for  humans,  but  was  tried,  and  successfully,  on  the  dog  in  this  case. 
Worms  may  have  been  the  original  cause  of  this  case  of  dysentery.  Dry 
browned  toast  soaked  in  meat  broths  or  gravy  is  very  good  food  to  use  in 
such   cases   of  dysentery. 

Dent  has  written  especially  for  this  book  the  following  on  Dysentery: 

"This  disease  is  frequently  neglected  with  the  false  hope  that  it  will 
cure  itself.  It  is  a  serious  affection  and  demands  prompt  care  and  treat- 
ment. Causes  are  inflammation  of  the  mucous  membrane  of  the  lower 
bowels  or  large  intestines,  accompanied  by  ulceration,  and  in  many  cases 
bleeding.  The  action  of  poisons,  eating  of  putrid  food,  rapid'  changes  from 
heat  to  cold  and.  vice  versa,  also  the  after-effects  of  inflammation  of  the 
small  intestines. 

"Symptoms. — At  first  there  is  a  loss  of  appetite,  restlessness,  painful 
condition  of  the  bowels,  as  attested  by  pressure  on  the  belly.  The  nose  is 
hot  and  dry,  the  animal  is  feverish,  and  at  first  constipated.  Afterwards 
the  bowels,  after  more  or  less  straining,  begin  to  move,  the  passages  are 
putrid  and  more  disagreeable,  become  more  frequent  and  tinged  with  blood 
as  a  result  of  injury  to  the  bowels,  or  with  pus  as  a  result  of  ulceration. 

"Treatment. — Give  a  dose  to  a  40-lb.  dog,  %oz.  each  of  olive  oil  and 
castor  oil,  to  which  can  be  added  from  10  to  20  drops  of  laudanum;  small- 
er and  larger  dogs  a  proportonate  dose.  Give  injections  of  boiled  starch 
water,  with  20  to  40  drops  of  laudanum.  If  the  disease  has  become  chronic 
it  may  be  necessary  to  try  several  different  prescriptions  before  arriving 
at  a  cure.     Here  is  one: 

Sub-nitrate    of   bismuth    2   drams 

Ipecacuana   powdered    30  grains 

Pepsin     1   dram 

Siastrase    ,  4  grains 

Dose. — Divide  into   12   powders  and  give  one  three  times  a  day. 


 


"And  here  another: 


Acid    tannic 2   drams 

Opium  powdered    12   grains 

Pepsin 1  dram 

"Dose. — Divide  into  12  powders  and  give  one  three  times  a  day.  The 
foregoing-sized  doses  are  based  on  a  40-lb.  dog.  Smaller  or  larger  dogs 
in  proportion.  Feed  white  of  egg,  gelatin,  beef  tea,  lime  water  and 
milk,  toast  and  beef  tea.     Keep  the  patient  warm  and  quiet." 

Diarrhea. — Diarrhea  is  of  very  frequent  occurrence  in  dogs,  and  more 
particularly  in  young,  puppies  and  in  old  and  overfed  dogs.  It  generally 
exists  as  a  result  of  indigestion,  brought  on  by  improper  feeding.  The 
practice  of  leaving  stale  food  from  one  meal  to  another  is  a  common  source 
of  this  disease.  Diarrhea  may  be  classed  as  acute  and  chronic.  In  the 
acute  form  there  is  much  looseness  of  the  bowels,  frequently  accompanied 
or  preceded  by  copious  vomiting  of  acrid  offensive  matter;  the  evacua- 
tions are  loose,  watery  and  offensive.  If  not  checked,  it  soon  produces 
excessive  weakness,  and,  especially  in  puppies,  is  the  cause  of  great  mor- 
tality. In  the  chronic  state  the  disease  is  slower  in  its  progress  and  longer 
in  its  duration.  It  may  be  set  up  by  a  diseased  liver  and  excess  of  bile,  or 
it  may  be  the  result  of  inflammation  of  the  bowels.  A  by  no  means  un- 
common cause  is  the  abuse  of  calomel  and  other  mercurials,  these  being 
"specifics"  with  many  persons  for  all  dog  diseases.  Diarrhea  often  finishes 
up  the  work  of  distemper,  and  this  is  so  in  most  cases  where,  as  too  fre- 
quently happens,  mercurials  have  been  relied  on  as  a  cure  for  that  dis- 
ease. Worms  are  also  a  common  cause  of  diarrhea,  and  when  these  exist 
the  nature  of  the  discharge  is  variable,  frequent  and  small  in  quantity, 
Sometimes  lumpy,  followed  by  gelatinous,  glary  matter,  and  often  frothy 
and  covered  with  small  air  bubbles.  When  worms  appear  to  be  the  cause, 
means  should  be  taken  to  expel  them  as  directed  later  on.  Exhalations 
from  accumulations  of  filth,  and  especially  in  low  lying,  damp  and  badly 
drained  and  badly  ventilated  kennels,  are  also  a  cause  of  diarrhea,  and 
one  which  never  should  exist.  In  treating  diarrhea  it  is  often  of  con- 
siderable advantage  to  give  a  mild  purge  to  remove  the  irritating  cause. 
Castor  oil  is  very  suitable;  and,  if  there  is  evidence  of  much  pain  attend- 
ing the  disease,  a  dose  of  laudanum,  from  20  to  30  drops,  may  be  added. 
As  a  remedy  in  diarrhea  I  know  of  nothing  equal  to  the  following  mix- 
ture, which  very  rarely  fails  to  check  it  if  the  patient  at  the  same  time 
receives  proper  attention  in  other  respects: 

Astringent  Anodyne  Mixture  for  Diarrhea. 

Take  prepared  chalk 3   drams 

Aramatic   confection    (powder)     :  .    2   drams 

Powdered  gum  acacia 1   dram 

(Laudanum)    tincture  of  opium    1   ounce 

Oil  of  cassia   6   or  8   drops 

Tincture  of  catechu    3  drams 


 

Spiritis  of  sal  volatile' 2    drams 

Water  sufficient  to  make   8   ounces      • 

The  powders  must  be  rubbed  very  fine  in  a  mortar,  the  oil  of  cassia  within 
them;  the  water  must  be  gradually  added,  rubbing  well  to  form  a  smooth 
mixture.  The  tincture  added  in  the  bottle.  Of  this  mixture  the  dose  will 
be  from  a  half  to  two  teaspoonfuls  for  puppies,  and  from  one  to  two  table- 
spoonfuls  for  full-grown  dogs,  given  every  three  or  four  hours,  as  long  as 
the  purging  continues.  The  bottle  must  be  well  shaken  before  measuring 
the  dose. 

When  getting  this  filled,  I  would  advise,  either  taking  your  book 
to  the  druggist,  or  copying  and  showing  him  as  to  the  mixing  of  the  above. 

For  convenience  of  form  the  following  may,  under  circumstances,  be 
preferred,  as  it  keeps  well  and  is  in  less  compass:* 

Spirits   of  camphor    2  drams 

Laudanum     xk  ounce 

Spirits  of  volatile    '.  .    2  drams 

Tincture  of  catechu 1  ounce 

Mix.  Dose,  from  twenty  drops  to  a  teaspoonful  in  water  every  three  or 
four  hours,  if  required. 

"The  diet  must  be  carefully  regulated  all  through  the  disease;  such 
light  and  easily-digested  food  as  well  boiled  oatmeal,  rice  or  arrowroot 
should  be  given,  with  milk  or  beef  tea,  and  if  the  patient  refuses  to  feed, 
a  little  should  be  given  with  a  spoon  or  a  drencher  every  two  or  three 
hours;  when  the  dog  is  very  weak,  add  a  little  port  wine  to  the  food;  in- 
stead of  plain  water,  give  rice  or  barley  water  to  drink.  In  the  case  of 
bitches  suckling,  the  diet  must  be  changed,  a  dose  of  castor  oil  given,  and 
the  'astringent  anodyne  mixture'  in  small  closes,  or  an  injection  may.  be 
administered. 

"If  the  diarrhea  is  very  persistent,  and  accompanied  by  blood,  inject 
twice  a  day  into  the  rectum  2  gr.  to  5  gr.  of  sulphate  of  copper  with  15  to 
60  drops  of  tincture  of  opium  in  4  oz.  of  water.  If  this  does  not  check  it, 
then  give  %  gr.  to  Vz  gr.  of  sulphate  of  copper,  increasing  the  dose  to 
1  gr.  with   V2   gr.  to   1  gr.  of  powdered  opium. 

"It  is  most  important  that  rigorous  cleanliness  should  be  observed. 
All  discharges  should  be  immediately  removed,  and  the  animal  kept  clean 
by  sponging  with  lukewarm  water  if  necessary,  while  disinfectants  should 
be  sprinkled  'about.  The  patient  should  also  be  kept  warm,  and  left  as 
quiet  and  undisturbed  as  possible. 

Dr.  Clayton's  diarrhea  cure  I  have  found  a  very  good  remedy  in  many 
cases.  Spratt's  Patent  (see  advertisement)  makes  a  diarrhea  pill  that  I 
have  often  used  on  my  dogs,  and  with  great  success,  in  checking  up  this 
trouble,  which  is  often  caused  in  dogs  at  a  show  by  the  change  in  water 
drank  there  and  on  the  trip.  A  tablet  or  pill  is  often  more  easily  admin- 
istered than  a  liquid. 

A  party  wrote  as  to  a  diarrhea  from  distemper  in  a  six-months-old 
pointer  puppy,  just  over  the  distemper,  that  is  getting  along  nicely  and 


 

has  a  fairly  good  appetitte,  but  is  bothered  with  diarrhea.  His  passages 
are  very  thin  and  very  offensive.  The  puppy  tries  to  do  something  quite 
often,  and  then  walks  all  over  the  kennel  yard  and  passes  a  few  drops  only. 
At  the  first  stage  of  the  distemper  I  doctored  him  for  worms  and  took  many 
from  him.  For  the  last  five  or  six  weeks  I  have  fed  him  on  eggs  and  milk, 
boiled  together,  with  a  few  crackers  in  each  mess.  The  diarrhea  seems  to 
hold  him  back  so  he  don't  get  fat  as  he  should.  The  answer  was  to  give 
the  dog  the  following,  and,  if  necessary,  to  repeat  the  dose: 

Chalk    5  grains 

Laudanum     5  grains 

Ether     5   drops 

Mix  and  give  in  soup  or  milk;  continue  same  feeding  and  to  also  give  dry, 
well-browned  toast  soaked  in  meat  broths  or  meat  gravy  made  with  flour 
in  it.     Understand  that  the  above  prescription  was  for  one  dose. 

Dislocations. — It  is  much  the  safest  and  best  plan  in  such  cases  to  at 
once  summon  the  veterinarian,  and  not  trust  to  yourself,  as  the  veretin- 
arian's  knowledge  of  anatomy  and  experience  in  operations  of  this  kind 
enables  him  to  perform  it  more  readily,  and  with  the  least  pain  possible 
to  the  dog.  If  you  are  situated  so  that  you  cannot  secure  the  veterinary, 
first  examine  and  determine  in  what  direction  the  bone  is  parted  from  its 
socket;  for  instance,  in  dislocation  of  the  hip,  the  head  of  the  thigh  bone 
is  generally  carried  upwards  and  backwards,  this  being  apparent  to  the 
eye,  as  the  injured  side  is  thereby  made  higher  and  can  readily  be  felt. 
Have  an  assistant  to  hold  the  dog  around  the  loins  steady  in  one  position, 
while  you  take  hold  of  the  dislocated  limb  above  the  stifle  joint,  which  will 
retract  the  thigh  bone  downward  and  forward.  In  similar  operations  you 
must  be  guided  by  the  same  principle.  Rest  will  be  needed  for  the  pa- 
tient, and  violent  exercise  must  not  be  allowed  for  some  time.  There  is 
always  a  disposition  to  a  repetition  of  a  dislocation. 

Dropsy. — This  is  an  unnatural  accumulation,  of  water  in  different  parts 
of  the  body,  as  in  water  on  the  brain,  dropsy  of  the  chest,  dropsy  of  the 
skin,  and  dropsy  of  the  belly;  and  it  is  the  last-named  to  which  the  dog 
is  most  liable.  Dropsy  is  generally,  if  not  always,  the  result  of  some  other 
debilitating  disease,  and  especially  of  inflammatory  disorders;  but  it  may 
be  brought  on  by  unsuitable  diet,  or  by  the  abuse  of  drastic  purgatives. 
With  the  development  of  shows  a  new  danger  has  sprung  up,  as  dogs  are 
too  often  kept  on  their  benches  to  the  suppression  of  the  discharge  of  thf' 
excretions,  which  is  a  recognized  caused  of  inducing  dropsy.  Dropsy  of  the 
belly  need  not  in  the  bitch  be  mistaken  for  pregnacy,  for  in  the  latter 
the  teats  enlarge  with  the  belly,  which  is  altogether  firmer,  and  does  not 
droop  until  just  before  whelping,  while  the  puppies  can  be  felt  through  the 
abdominal  walls.  In  dropsy  the  belly  is  more  pendulous  and  baggy,  the 
back  is  arched,  and  the  water  moves  readily  under  pressure;  the  dropsical 
animal,  too,  is  generally  poor  in  flesh  and  harsh  in  coat.  The  medicines 
principally  employed  in  dropsy  are  iodine,  iron  and  other  mineral  tonics, 


with  digitalis  and  diuretics;  5  to  15  drops  of  benzoate  of  ammonium,  or 
1  to  3  drops  of  oil  of  juniper,  with  5  to  20  drops  of  tincture  of  nux  vomica, 
in  water,  three  times  a  day,  are  also  useful  in  treating  the  disease  which, 
however,  is  always  best  left  to  a  veterinary  surgeon. 

Dyspepsia. — See  Indigestion. 

Diabetes. — This  is  an  increased  abnormal  flow  of  urine,  the  cause 
being  a  derangement  of  some  of  the  assimilative  organs,  and  when  long 
established  producing  great  emaciation  and  weakness.  First,  give  a  few 
doses  of  mild  purgative,  of  the  "podophyllin  pills." 

Podolphyllin    3  grains 

Compound  extract  of  colocynth   15  grains 

Powdered    rhubarb    24  grains 

Extract  of  henbane 18  grains 

Mix  and  divide  into  12  pills.  Dose  one  or  two  pills,  according  to  size  of 
dog.     One  or  two  doses  probably  enough,  if  it  moves  the  bowels. 

To  allay  the  thirst,  always  present  in  diabetes,  give  (twice  a  day)  5 
to  30  drops  (according  to  size  of  dog)  of  phosphoric  acid,  largely  diluted 
with  water,  and-  to  strengthen  the  system,  2  to  5  grains  of  sulphate  of  iron 
twice  a  day  in  water.  If  the  excessive  flow  of  urine  continues  after  this, 
then  use  the  following. 

Astringent  Bolus  for  Diabetes — Take 

Gallic    acid    1  dram 

Powdered  alum    1   dram 

Powdered   opium    12   grains 

Gum  sufficient  to  form  a  mass;  divide  into  24  pills.  Dose  for  a  25-lb.  to 
50-lb.  dog,  one  pill  twice  a  day.  Small  toy  dogs,  one-half  pill.  And  larger 
than  50-lb.,  1  x/2  pill  as  a  dose.  Where  the  dog  is  weak  and  his  appetite 
impaired,  have  druggist  add  one  grain  of  quinine  to  each  pill  when  filling 
prescription. 

Another  case  was  prescribed  for  as  follows: 

"My  Cocker  bitch  drinks  a  great  deal  more  water  than  two  or  three 
of  my  other  dogs  drink,  and  she  also  passes  a  great  deal  of  water — more 
than  any  of  my  other  dogs.     Will  you  advise  me  what  to  do? 

From  symptoms  you  mention  the  dog  probably  has  diabetes.  Give 
some  mild  purgative  for  a  few  days.  To  allay  the  thirst  give  twice  a  day 
5  to  30  drops  (according  to  size  of  dog)  of  phosphoric  acid  largely  diluted 
with  water.  A  dose  of  sulphate  of  iron,  2  to  5  grains,  twice  a  day  will 
tone  up  the  system.  If  the  excessive  flow  continues  after  this  treatment 
use  the  following  prescription:  Gallic  acid  (one  dram),  powdered  alum 
(one  dram),  powdered  opium   (12  grains),  gum  sufficient  to  form  a  mass, 


 

and  divide  into  24  pills.  For  dogs  25  to  50  pounds  in  weight  give  one 
pill  twice  a  day;  Toy  dogs,  one-half  pill.  Twenty-four  grains  quinine 
added  to  the  prescription  will  be  of  value  if  the  dog  is  weak  or  appetite 
impaired." 

The  following,  from  Field  and  Fancy,  is  also  valuable  advice: 

"Diabetes  is  characterized  by  an  abnormal  flow  of  urine,  caused  by 
derangement  of  some  of  the  assimilative  organs;  when  long  established 
it  produces  great  emaciation  and  weakness.  The  treatment  consists  in  giv- 
ing first  a  few  doses  of  a  mild  purgative,  such  as  the  podophyllin  pills. 
To  allay  the  thirst,  which  is  always  present  in  diabetes,  give  twice  a 
day  5  to  30  droys  of  phosphoric  acid,  largely  diluted  with  water,  and  to 
strengthen  the  system  2  gr.  to  5  gr.  of  suphate  of  iron  twice  a  day  in 
water.  If  the  excessive  flow  of  urine  continues  after  this  treatment,  resort 
must  be  had  to  opium,  iodine,  alum,  oak-bark,  or  its  preparations.  The 
following  bolus  may  prove  useful  in  such  cases: 

Astringent  Bolus  for  Diabetes. — Take  gallic  acid,  1  dr.;  powdered  alum, 
1  dr.;  powdered  opium,  12  gr. ;  gum  sufficient  to  form  a  mass;  divide 
into  twenty-four  pills.  Dose  for  a  twenty  pound  dog,  one  twice  a  day. 
Where  the  animal  is  weak  and  the  appetite  impaired,  1  gr.  of  quinine  may 
be  added   to  each  pill." 

Diptheria. — Some  veterinarians  hold  that  dogs  are  liable  to  this  alarm- 
ing and  fatal  disease.  At  the  slightest  suspicion  of  diphtheria,  isolate  the 
patient,  as  it  is  contagious,  and  call  in  a  veterinary  surgeon  at  once. 

I  have  never  had  a  case  of  diphtheria  as  yet  in  any  of  my  dogs,  but 
should  I  have,  would  at  once  call  in  a  good  doctor  or  veterinarian.  This 
disease  should  be  treated  the  same  as  if  in  a  person. 

Dent,  at  my  request,  furnishes  the  following  article  on  this  disease: 

"There*  has  been  considerable  discussion  over  this  disease,  which  is 
so  alarming  in  the  human  family.  While  some  veterinarians  hold  that 
this  disease  does  not  exist  in  dogs,  others  contend  as  religiously  that  it  does. 

"There  are  cases  on  record  where  a  dog  has  contracted  the  disease 
from  eating  the  food  that  had  previously  been  placed  before  an  affected 
child,  and  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  the  disease  is  communicable 
from  man  to  dog,  and  vice  versa,  when  we  consider  the  intimate  terms  under 
which   they  exist. 

"The  cause  of  this  disease  in  the  dog,  as  in  man,  is  a  specific  germ 
which  attacks  the  throat,  or  nose,  or  both  and  extends  from  them  down 
into  the  wind  pipe. 

"Symptoms. — Difficulty  in  swallowing,  more  or  less  difficulty  in  breath- 
ing,  chills,  fever,  marked  debility  and  exhaustion. 

"Treatment. — The  slightest  suspicion  of  this  disease  calls  for  isolation, 
increased  attention  to  sanitation,  careful  disinfection,  and  the  attenton  of  a 
skillful  veterinarian,  who  should  use  antitoxin  exactly  as  used  in  human 
practice.  Feed  easily  digested  food,  and  as  the  animal  passes  the  critical 
period  and  approaches  convalescene,  use  a  good  tonic  condition  pill,  any 
of  thoso  advertised  in  this  book." 


 

Deafness. — A  very  considerable  number  of  dogs  suffer  from  deafness. 
In  many  the  disease  is  congenital,  but  I  do  not  know  that  it  is  hereditary; 
and  I  am  quite  at  a  loss  to  explain  why  congenital  deafness  is  so  much 
oftener  seen  in  white  dogs,  or  those  with  a  preponderance  of  white,  than 
in  those  of  any  other  color.  Bulldogs,  bull  terriers  and  white  English 
terriers  seem  to  be  peculiarly  liable  to  this  defect.  Deafness  is  also  fre- 
quently caused  by  accumulations  of  wax  and  this  can  be  removed  by  syring- 
ing the  ear  daily  with  1  part  of  spirits  of  wine  and  20  parts  of  warm  water, 
afterwards  drying  the  ear  thoroughly,  by  means  of  a  piece  of  wool  rolled 
upon  a  probe  or  pointed  piece  of  stick.  Several  fresh  pieces  of  wool  will  be 
necessary.     Canker  is  also  a  fruitful  cause  of  deafness. 

I  know  of  no  treatment  for  congenital  deafness  likely  to  be  of  any 
use  except  when  it  is  caused  by  a  morbid  growth  capable  of  being  removed. 
Among  other  causes  producing  deafness,  blows  may  be  mentioned;  also 
lugging  at  the  ear — a  most  brutal  mode  of  punishment  often  resorted  to 
by  keepers  and  those  having  the  care  of  sporting  field  dogs — and  the  lodg- 
ment of  water  in  the  ear  cavity.  In  the  latter  case,  pouring  in  a  little  pure 
oil  of  sweet  almonds  may  give  relief;  and  in  the  other  cases  the  treatment 
recommended  for  internal  canker  may  be  beneficially  followed  with,  in 
addition,  the  application  of  a  blister  behind  the  ears.  Whilst  the  dog  is 
under  treatment,  cooling,  aperient  medicine  should  be  given,  and  a  light 
diet  with  green  vegetables  adopted.  You  will  find  that  dogs  born  deaf, 
like  a  deaf  and  dumb  person,  have  their  other  senses  quickened,  and  the 
dog  will  be  remarkably  sharp  at  interpreting  signs  given  by  the  master, 
who  should  adopt  a  system  of  signs  and  keep  to  them.  If  you  own  a  deaf 
dog,  you  should  have  an  enclosed  yard  for  him  so  no  danger  of  his  getting 
out  on  the  street  and  hurt  or  killed  by  a  passing  wagon  or  street  car — 
and  remember,  if  you  have  him  out  for  a  walk,  that  he  is  deaf,  so  that  no 
harm  befalls  him;  you  do  the  watching  out  in  this  case.  Deafness  does 
not  transmit — simply  happens — so  that  a  deaf  bitch  will  be  just  as  good 
to  use  for  breeding  purposes.  ■ 

Epilepsy. — Dogs  are  peculiarly  liable  to  this  trouble.  The  symptoms 
are  sudden  loss  of  sensation,  a  violent  convulsive  action  of  the  muscles, 
both  of  the  body  and  limbs,  champing  of  the  jaws  and  emission  of  froth 
from  the  mouth,  the  tongue  may  get  cut  by  the  involuntary  action  of  the 
jaw  and  being  tinged  with  blood  adds  to  the  fears  of  those  ignorant  of 
the  disease,  and  from  this  unfounded  alarm  the  dog  may  be  supposed  to 
be  mad  (?)  and  the  poor  fellow  killed.  See  treatment  under  head  of 
Epileptic  Fits. 

Eye,  Diseases  of  the Dogs  are  subject  to  all  eye  troubles  that  hu- 
mans are,  and  perhaps  more  so.  Eye  troubles  I  have  had  great  success 
in  treating,  and  when  I  see  them  appear  in  a  dog  I  am  not  at  all  worried. 
They  must  be  cared  for  at  once,  however.  Accidents  to  the  eye  are  not 
uncommon,  as  from  scratches  by  a  cat,  injuries  from- a  blow,  or  in  fighting. 
In  such  cases  the  first  thing  to  do  is  to  bathe  it  with  warm  water  for 
from  fifteen  to  thirty  minutes,  this  to  reduce  the  swelling  and  inflamma- 
tion which  follows.     If  the  injury  is  great,  a  veterinarian  had  best  be  called 


 

in  but  otherwise  Eberhart's  Eye  Lotion,  "No    1"  or  "No.   2,"  can  be  used 
three  or  four  times  daily  with  good  results,  just  a  few  drops: 

Eberhart's  Eye  Lotion — No.    1. 

Cocaine     10   grains 

Sulphate   of   zinc    10   grains 

Rose  water,  imported    2  ounces 

Now,  as  to  the  above,  this  is  the  one  I  had  in  First  Edition  of  this 
book,  only  there  I  had  in  it  38  grains  of  cocaine,  instead  of  10  grains,  as 
in  this.  Under  the  old  formula  I  used  it  "for  years,  and  with  it  I  saved 
the  sight  of  hundreds  of- dogs. 

A  lady  living  near  New  York  had  a  Blenheim  spaniel  that  was  nearly 
blind  from  diseased  eyes.  She  took  it  to  a  celebrated  occulist  in  New  York, 
who  pronounced  it  a  hopeless  case,  telling  her  that-  the  dog  would  go  totally 
blind,  and  very  soon.  She  wrote  me  and  I  sent  her  this  prescription,  and 
in  a  couple  of  weeks  her  dog's  eyes  were  as  sound  and  well  as  any  dog's 
eyes  ever  were.  The  dog's  eyes  were  apparently  nearly  dropping  out  of  its 
head,  and  looked  as  if  you  could  knock  them  off  with  your  finger,  when 
she  took  him  to  this  eye  doctor.  When  she,  after  the  cure,  showed  the  dog 
to  the  doctor  he  could  hardly  believe  it  was  the  same  dog,  and  said:  "Well, 
it's  simply  wonderful." 

Now   here   is 

Eberhart's  Eye  Lotion  "No.  2." 

Acid    boracic     10  grains 

Cocaine     9  grains 

Sulphate  of  zinc    ". 2  grains 

Aqua    camphor     1  tablespoonful 

Aqua    rosa     1  tablespoonful 

Drop  in  eye,  a  few  drops,  two  or  three  times  daily. 

I  now  consider  "No.  2"  a  better  one  than  "No.  1,"  for  most  all  eye 
troubles,  and  have  used  it  for  several  years  instead  of  "No.  1."  It  can 
never  do  any  harm,  but  always  benefit.  This  one,  due  to  the  camphor 
water  in  it,  will  not  keep  well  for  over  a  few  weeks  or  so,  and  therefore 
should  this  be  remembered  and  not  used  when  having  stood  too  long. 
Either  should  be  always  tightly  corked,  and  a  glass  stoppered  bottle  is 
much  the  best.  Only  get  half  the  prescription  filled  at  a  time,  probably 
enough  for  the  case,  and  saves  extra  expense.  If  any  trouble  in  getting  it, 
I  can  sent  it  by  mail  for  sixty  cents. 

AVhenever  I  find  any  trouble  in  any  of  my.  dogs  eyes  I  at  once  use  the 
No.  2,  even  in  case  of  a  slight  cold  caught  and  which  had  settled  into  the 
eye,  as  shown  by  inflammation,  mattery  or  watery  discharge,  or  even  only 
an  apparent  weakness  or  blinking  when  dog  was  exposed  to  a  strong  light. 
In  such   cases,  bathing   the  eyes   first,   with   a   Boracic  Acid  solution,    (how 


 

to  make  is  given  under  that  heading),  see  index,  just  a  couple  drops  twice 
a   day,   is  required. 

Pugs,  toy  spaniels  and  all  dogs  with  prominent  or  "pop  eyes,"  as 
they  are  termed,  are  greatly  troubled  with  their  eyes,  and  here  is  where 
I  found  out  the  merits  of  my  own  eye  remedies. 

You  may  discover  some  morning  the  eye  of  your  dog  covered  with 
a  blue  film,  this  is  so  common  in  pop  eyed  dogs  that  I  named  it  "blue  eye" 
for  short.  Very  rapidly  this  eye,  the  ball,  will  enlarge,  and  if  not  promptly 
treated  will  assume  proportions  that  are  apparently  startling,  and  in  a 
few  days  if  not  taken  care  of,  the  ball  of  the  eye  would  bulge  out  so  much 
that  it  would  seem  as  if  it  would  drop  out  of  its  head.  Don't  be  alarmed, 
for  my  lotion  "No.  2"  will  take  care  of  this,  will  cure  the  eye,  which 
in  due  time  will  be  sound  as  ever,  the  same  as  it  was  before  this  trouble 
appeared,  and  the  sight  saved,  as  perfect  as  ever.  No.  2  will  never  fail  to 
cure  ulceration  and  perforation  of  the  ball  of  the  eye  if  used  in  time.  In 
some  cases  a  white  spot  or  speck  will  remain,  but  the  sight  is  all  right, 
and  to  remove  this  spot  use  the  following: 

Eye  Salve. 

Vaseline    1   ounce 

Yellow  oxide  of  mercury    2   grains 

Mix,  use  daily,  putting  inside  the  eye  a  portion  about  the  size  of  a  pea, 
then  closing  the  eye  rub  it  gently.  This  prescription  should  be 
thoroughly  and  carefully  mixed  by  your  druggist.  This  is  very  im- 
portant- 

In  other  cases  the  "No.  2"  has  done  all  the  curing,  and  there  was  no 
white  spot  left.  Due  to  the  present  stringent  laws  in  many  states  as  to 
narcotics,  it  will  be  necessary  to  have  your  doctor  write  this  prescription 
because  of  the  cocaine  in  it.  Where  I  'discovered"  this  "No.  2"  was  in 
the  case  of  a  Pug  dog  I  had  bought,  that  when  I  received  her  from  the 
express  company,  had  gotten  this  on  her  long  trip,  and  I  at  once  took  her 
to  my  own  eye  doctor,  Dr.  Robert  C.  Heflebower,  (now  one  of  the  greatest, 
if  not  the  greatest,  eye  specialist  in  the  .world,  today.  My  bill  with  him 
for  this  dog  was  eighteen  dollars),  and  now  with  "No.  2"  it  can  be  cured 
for  less  than  a  dollar.  I  consider  this  "No.  2"  worth  more  than  twenty 
times  the  cost  of  a  copy  of  this  book. 

Dogs  are  subject  to  affections  of  the  eye  in  more  or  less  degree  ac- 
cording to  their  breed  and  uses.  Hunting  dogs  are  naturally,  owing  to  the 
nature  of  their  work,  more  subject  than  other  dogs  to  receive  injuries 
from  thorns,  dust  and  dirt  and  other  foreign  matter.  This  will  be  followed 
by  more  or  less  inflammation  of  the  mucous  membrane  lining  the  eye- 
lids, which  is  attended  by  a  watery  discharge  at  first  and  assuming  a  more 
purulent  condition  as  the  trouble  increases. 

It  is  well  known  that  a  small  particle  of  grit  may  remain  under  an 
eyelid  in  spite  of  fomentations,  and  should  the  eye  be  examined  without 
discovery  of  the  source  of  trouble,  very  often  an  application  of  pure  olive 
oil  with  a   camel's  hair  brush   to   the   underpart  of  the   eyelid   Avill   often 


succeed  in  carrying  off  the  irritant,  which  may  be  too  small  to  discern. 
This,  however,  is  usually  to  be  considered  merely  a  preliminary  step,  and 
my  Eye  Lotion  No.  2  should  be  then  used  to  remove  the  inflammation  thus 
caused.  If  your  dog  brings  about  a  swollen  or  inflamed  condition  of  the 
eyelids  through  a  chance  scratch  of  the  claws  in  rubbing  their  face,  use 
my  Eye  Lotion  No.  2,  after  having  first  bathed  the  parts  with  warm  water. 
Different  form  of  indigestion  may  be  associated  with  irritation  of  the 
mucous  membranes  throughout,  and  the  eyes  will  suffer  in  common  with 
the  other  parts.  Rheumatism  is  also  one  of  the  maladies  which  are  at- 
tended with  inflammation,  more  or  less  pronounced,  of  the  eyes,  with  the 
eyeball  itself  and  the  lids  participating  in  the  disorder.  It  must,  therefore, 
be  obvious  that  the  common  expression,  "a  discharge  from  the«eyes,"  may 
refer  to  a  variety  of  morbid  conditions  which  are  not  to  be  counteracted 
by  an  application  of  a  lotion  to  the  eye.  Perhaps  a  safe  guide  for  the 
tyro  in  medicine  may  be  found  in  the  duration  of  the  discharge.  In  any 
case  of  simple  irritation  from  the  presence  of  dirt  or  grit  it  may  be  fairly  ex- 
pected that  the  symptoms  will  cease  very  quickly  upon  the  application  of 
simple  remedies,  that  is  to  say  after  it  has  been  clearly  ascertained  that 
there  is  no  offending  body  adherent  to  the  underneath  part  of  the  eyelid. 
The  continuance  of  the  discharge  week  after  week,  or  even  month  after 
month,  may  certainly  be  taken  to  mean  that  something  more  than  ordinary 
irritation  of  a  simple  kind  is  present,  and  under  such  circumstances  the 
chances  are  that  the  common  eye  water,  for  example,  three  or  four  grains  of 
boracic  acid  in  an  ounce  of  rose  water,  for  example,  three  or  four  grains  of 
possibly  do  some  harm  by  checking  the  discharge,  which  is  really  critical 
in  its  character.  The  proper  course  in  such  cases  would  be  to  consult  an 
expert  in  diseases  of  the  dog,  who  will  most  probably  be  able  to  find  some 
constitutional  cause  to  account  for  what  has  been  looked  upon  as  a  local 
disorder. 

Eye,  Amaurosis  of  the. — This  is  a  loss  of  sight,  partial  or  entire,  arising 
from  one  of  several  causes;  the  optic  nerve  is  palsied,  which  may  have 
arisen  from  a  blow  near  the  eye.  Exhaustion  from  suckling  will  produce 
amaurosis  and  bitches  sometimes  exhibit  it  during  gestation;  excess  of  light 
is  also  a  cause.  The  eye  is  unnaturally  clear  and  glittering,  the  pupil  ex- 
panded and  fixed,  and  that  the  dog  is  partially  or  entirely  blind  is  seen  by 
his  stepping  high  and  with  needless  care  when  nothing  is  in  his  way  and 
running  against  things  that  are.  If  when  you  feint  a  blow  the  eye  does  not 
move,    total   blindness   may   be   assumed. 

Eberhart's  Eye  Lotion  No.  2  (See  Opthalmia)  may  do  a  lot  of  good  if 
used  at  once,  as  I  have  never  found  any  case  of  eye  trouble  that  it  did  not 
help  or  cure.  This  eye  lotion  should  not  be  kept  on  hand  very  long,  how- 
ever, as  the  camphor  water  in  it  destroys  its  virtues  after  a  time.  If  you 
find  the  trouble  due  to  a  deranged  nervous  system,  3  to  10  drops  of  tincture 
of  nux  vomica  in  a  little  water,  twice  daily  after  food,  is  useful. 

Eyeball,  Protrusion  of. — It  sometimes  occures  in  fighting  that  the  eye- 
ball is  forced  out  of  its  socket,  and  the  lid,  contracting,  prevents  its  return. 
I  cannot  recommend  the  amateur  to  attempt  to  return  the  eyeball  to  its 


place,  but  the  veterinary  surgeon  should  be  sent  for,  and  in  the  meantime 
a  small  stream  of  lukewarm  water  should  be  kept  running  onto  the  part 
to  keep  the  muscles  relaxed  as  much  as  possible,  to  facilitate  the  necessary 
operations  in   returning  the  eyeball  to  its  place. 

Eyes,  Watery  or  Weeping. — This  trouble  seems  to  be  inherited  by 
some  breeds  of  dogs,  such  as  Italian  greyhounds,  Blenheim  spaniels,  Mal- 
tese terriers  and  white  Toy  poodles.  In  these  cases  a  strong  astringent 
will  do  harm  and  induce  inflammation.  Bathing  with  an  infusion  of  green 
tea  will  have  a  good  effect,  and  the  use  of  the  following  simple  eye  lotion 
will  do  much  good.  I  use  it  for  any  ordinary  inflammation  due  to  a  cold. 
Take  2  grams  of  ordinary  rochelle  salts  to  2  ounces  of  rose  water  and  drop 
in  eyes  twice  a  day.  Being  a  cheap  remedy,  I  also  bathe  the  eyes  with  it 
instead  of  water,  a  six  ounce  mixture  only  costing  a  dime  of  any  reasonable 
druggist.  This  weakness  may  arise  from  a  slight  inflammation.  A  purge 
if  the  dog  is  gross  and  fat,  and  you  can  use  the  following  Lotion  for  Weak 
Eyes: 

Sulphate  of  zinc '. 12   grains 

Laudanum    %    ounce 

Distilled    water 6   ounces 

Eyelids,  Inversion  of  the  Lower  Lid  of This  causes  serious  trouble, 

opthalmia,  etc.  An  operation  is  the  only  means  of  cure,  which  should  be 
performed  by  a  skilled  veterinarian,  as  in  unskilled  hands  serious  mischief 
would  arise.  A  piece  of  skin  is  removed  below  the  eye,  and  a  small  muscle 
which  is  responsible  for  the  turning  in  of  the  eye,  is  severed.  The  wound 
should  not  be  sutured,  but  allowed  to  heal  under  a.  scab,  which  helps  to 
pull  the  eyelid  outward  and  slightly  downward,  relieving  the  condition 
naturally. 

This  is  not  very  common  in  many  breeds,  but  in  some  breeds  that  have 
a  small,  deep  set-in  eye,,  as  Chow  Chows,  some  Terriers,  it  is  often  found. 
If  an  operation  is  decided  upon,  remember  the  danger  of  chloroform  if  it 
be  a  Chow  Chow.  I  have  a  Chow  that  has  had  this  trouble  in  both  eyes, 
for  two  years  that  I  showed  and  made  a  champion  of  during  this  time.  I 
had  my  own  eye  specialist  come  to  my  kennels  prepared  to  perforin  the 
operation,  and  after  a  look  at  the  dog  and  his  eyes,  said  to  me:  "I  am 
afraid  if  I  give  this  dog  chloroform,  that  it  will  mean  a  dead  dog,"  so 
the  doctor  did  not  operate.  He  told  me,  however,  to  slip  the  hairs  off  of 
the  eyelid,  and  paint  with  colodion  every  few  days,  under  the  eyes  across 
the  lid,  about  a  quarter  of  an  inch  wide;  also,  to  wash  away  the  whitish 
discharge  morning  and  night,  and  then  to  drop  in  the  eyes  a  few  drops  of 
the  following: 

Hydrastes 2   drams 

Camphor   water    G   drams 

Which  treatment  I  am  keeping  up  yet,  the  result  being  that  the  dog's 
sight  is  as  keen  and  perfect  as   ever,   and  bids  fair   to   continue  so.     The 


 

colodion  dries  quickly,  and  then  after  dry,  I  put  a  second  coat  on  top  of 
the  first  one. 

* 
Eye  Iritis,  or  Inflammation  of  the  Iris,  is  sometimes  seen  in  dogs.     The 

iris  being  the  membrane  that  gives  the  color  to  the  eye,  in  the  center  of 

which  is  the  pupil.     Deep-seated  inflammation  is  usually  the  cause,   or  by 

direct   violence.      Symptoms   are   contraction   of   the   pupil,    which    does   not 

have  the  same  power  as  usual  of  contracting  and  dilating  to  regulate  the 

amount  of  light  to  be  admitted;   tears  flow  over  lid,  light  is  avoided,  and 

the  eye  is  bloodshot.      If  the  inflammation  increases  and  is  prolonged,  the 

usual   termination   would   be   suppuration    (formation   of   matter),   and   the 

loss  of  sight.     First  place  the  dog  in  a  darkened  kennel  or  room,  apply  hot 

fomentations   continuously  to   the   eye,   and   introduce  sulphate  of  atropine 

into  the  organ.     Discs  of  sulphate  of  atropine  you  can  get  at  your  druggist's, 

with  instructions  how  to  use. 

Eyelashes,  Turned  in. — This  occurs  occasionally,  the  eyelash  may  grow 
across  the  pupil,  interfering  with  the  dog's  comfort  and  vision.  In  ordi- 
nary cases  simply  clipping  with  the  scissors  will  do,  but  sometimes  excision 
and  cauterization  of  the  part  is  necessary.  Either  of  my  Eye  Lotions  to  be 
used  if  inflammation  is  present. 

Haw,  Enlargement  of. — The  haw,  or  third  eyelid,  as  it  is  sometimes 
called,  is  a  fold  of  membrane  situated  at  the  inner  corner  of  the  eye,  capable 
of  expansion,  and  is  used  to  sweep  across  the  globe  of  the  eye  to  cleanse  it 
from  flies,  dirt  or  other  foreign  bodies  that  have  blown  in.  This  membrane, 
from  constitutional  causes,  from  blows  or  irritation  from  extraneous  matter 
lodged  in  the  eye,  becomes  inflamed  and  enlarged,  which  interferes  with  the 
sight,  preventing  the  eyelids  from  closing.  My  Eye  Lotion  No.  2  would  do 
good  here  also,  the  treatment  being  astringent  lotions,  lunar  caustic,  or 
cutting  off  the  excrescent  growth,  according  to  the  circumstances  of  the  case. 

Eye,  Opthalmia  of  the — What  is  called  the  conjunctiva  is  the  mucous 
membrane  that  lines  the  inner  surface  of  the  eyelids,  and  as  its  name 
imports,  joints  these  with  the  eyeball,  and  opthalmia  is  an  inflammation 
of  this  mucous  membrane.  This  is  a  disease  unfortunately  common  in 
dogs;  it  varies  greatly  in  severity,  and  in  some  cases,  when  arising  from 
constitutional  causes,  becomes  chronic.  Sporting  dogs  have  been  said  to 
be  more  liable  to  it  than  other  breeds,  but  I  do  not  think  so,  and  I  believe 
the  idea  originated  from  the  fact  that  these  have  generally  been  more  ex- 
posed to  circumstances  exciting  it  than  other  breeds.  From  my  own  exper- 
ience, I  am  inclined  to  think  it  is  more  prevalent  in  pugs  and  other  pets 
overfed,  and  consequently  liable  to  frequent  derangement  of  the  digestive 
organs. 

Anything  that  will  set  up  local  irritation,  as  the  intrusion  of  dust,  flies, 
etc.,  or  the  scratch  of  a  cat,  or  a  blow,  exposure  to  sudden  and  extreme 
changes  of  temperature- — as  plunging  into  or  being  thrown  into  cold  water 
when  heated — and  excessive  exertion  is  occasionally  a  cause,  but  the  most 
common   sources   are   the   vapors   of   foul   kennels   or   hot   stables,   and   de- 


rangement  of  the  digestive  organs;  an  inverted  eyelash  may  occasion  it. 

Opthalmia  is  very  often  an  accompaniment  of  distemper.  There,  is  one 
form  of  disease  which  is  attended  with  considerable  discharge  from  the 
eyes  undoubtedly  possessing  contagious  qualities.  This  affection  is  known 
as  contagious  optbalmia.  Perhaps  the  most  marked  illustration  of  this  va- 
riety of  the  affection  in  the  dog  is  that  which  is  associated  with  distemper, 
and  it  may  be  noted  here  that  by  the  term  opthalmia  is  meant  the  disease 
which  implicates  the  eyeball  itself. 

The  symptoms  are  an  intolerance  of  light  and  a  watery  discharge, 
and  on  the  eyelids  being  opened  and  examined  there  is  seen  to  be  conges- 
tion of  the  lining  membrane,  and  across  the  cornea,  or  front  clear  portion 
of  the  eye,  there  are  red  streaks,  and  ulceration  soon  follows,  and  a  white 
film  abscures  the  eye  and  interferes  with  the  sight. 

More  or  less  opacity  of  the  cornea  is  one  of  the  symptoms  of  opthalmia 
either  of  the  simple  and  contagious  variety,  and,  in  the  case  of  the  dog 
affected  with  the  ophthalmia  of  distemper,  the  indications  are  of  a  most 
marked  character.  The  conjunctival  membrane  is  highly  injected  and 
reddened,  the  cornea  becomes  opaque  early  in  the  disease  and  very  fre- 
quently a  small  spot  of  ulceration  appears  in  the  center  of  it,  which  rapidly 
extends,  and  in  many  cases  penetrates  the  cornea,  completely  allowing 
the  fluid  in  the  anterior  chamber  of  the  eye  to  escape.  A  .profuse  dis- 
charge of  a  purulent  character  continues  during  the  whole  course  of  the 
disease,  and  one  of  the  annoying  features  of  the  complaint  is  the  glueing 
together  of  the  eyelids,  which  can  only  be  separated  by  very  careful  and 
continued   fomentations   of  warm  water   or,   what  is  better,   warm   milk. 

When  treating,  the  cause  should  be  first  sought  for,  and  if  it  is  some 
foreign  irritating  body,  or  an  eyelash  growing  in  a  wrong  direction,  these 
should  be  removed.  A  mild  dose  of  cooling  aperient  medicine  should  be 
given,  and  the  eye  should  be  well  and  frequently  bathed  with  a  decoction 
of  poppy  heads;  and  afterward,  if  the  inflammation  is  considerable,  the 
following   lotion   may   be   used   several   times  a   day   with   advantage: 

Eye  Lotion. — Extract  of  belladonna,  half  a  dram,  rose  water,  four 
ounces;"  wine  of  opium,  two  drams — mixed. 

Eye,  Cataract  of  the — This  is  an  opacity  of  the  eyeball,  a  whitish, 
opaque  spot,  which  gradually  enlarges  and  has  generally  ended  in  blind- 
ness. It  is  supposed  to  be  incurable  by  our  best  authorities,  generally 
occurring  in  aged  dogs — these  are  evidences  of  failing  health  and  probable 
breaking  up  of  the  system.  It  frequently  follows  ophtalmia,  but  might  be 
the  result  of  inflammation  or  a  wound,  or  blow.  My  Eye  Lotion  No.  2 
will   do  some  good   even   in  such   cases. 

Ear  Canker,  Internal. — There  are  two  forms  of  this  disease,  internal 
and  external,  the  latter  generally  the  result  of  the  former.  I  will  first 
prescribe  for  internal.  Canker  is  a  term  generally  applied  to  different 
obstinate,  corroding,  or  heating  humors,  horses  having  it  in  the  feet, 
sheep  having  "foot  rot;"  but  unless  the  irritation  is  caused  in  the  foot 
of  the  dog,  sometimes  by  hard  running  on  rough  ground,  causing  cankerous  sores,  and  which  should  be  treated  the  same  as  internal  ear  canker, 
it  is  not  found  in  dogs  except  in  the  ear. 

Causes. — First  of  all,  and  most  common,  is  some  injury,  such  as  blows 
on  the  ear  or  pulling  the  ears,  a  habit  some  people  have  as  a  method  of 
correction,  and  one  that  is  most  pernicious.  Others,  of  which  probably 
the  principal  one  is  getting  the  cars  full  of  water  in  diving,  swimming  or 
retrieving  from  water,  followed  by  lack  of  exercise;  too  rich  food,  dirty, 
damp  kennel  to  sleep  in,  and  excess  of  fat,  as  it  is  often  found  in  fat,  lazy 
dogs. 

Canker  may  be  the  result  of  exposure  to  cold,  over-feeding,  the  pres 
ence  of  insects;  foreign  bodies,  or  an  accumulation  of  wax  in  the  ear,  are 
also  fertile  causes,  while  the  most  common  is  the  washing  of  dogs  with 
coarse  alkaline  soaps  which  are  totally  unfit  for  the  sensitive  skin  of  the 
dog.  The  soap,  during  the  washing,  gains  access  to  the  ear,  setting  up 
dangerous   inflammation. 

Hugh  Dalziel  says:  "Is  there  not  another  and  frequent  cause — whether 
those  sportsmen  (?)  do  not  often  produce  it  who,  instead  of  correcting 
their  dogs  by  the  legitimate  means  of  the  voice  and  the  whip,  resort 
to  another  method  much  to  be  condemned.  'Lugging'  a  dog  is  as  cruel 
as  kicking  him,  neither  is  a  fit  mode  of  punishment  and  the  former 
very   likely  to   produce   canker." 

Ear  canker  is  one  of  the  nuisances  of  dog  keeping,  and  when  neg- 
lected is  a  most  obstinate  complaint.  The  experienced  dogman  is  always 
on  the  alert,  but  the  novice  may  not  detect  the  trouble  until  the  ear 
discharges  an  acrid  secretion.  The  careful  kennelman  will  examine  his 
dogs'  ears  as  a  part  of  the  daily  grooming. 

Internal  Canker  is  an  inflammation  of  the  lining  membrane  of  the 
passage  to  the  ear,  which  if  neglected  turns  into  ulceration  and  suppuration, 
and  when  of  long  standing  a  blackish,  offensive  discharge  takes  place, 
accumulating  in  the  air  passage,  and  the  interior  of  the  ear  will  be  found 
red  and  inflamed. 

When  you  notice  the  following  symptoms  begin  at  once  to  treat  him 
for  it,  the  sooner  the  better,  to  save  your  dog  pain  and  yourself  trouble: 

The  dog  thus  suffering  will  be  observed  frequently  scratching  his  ear 
with  his  paw,  holding  his  head  on  one  side,  giving  it  a  violent  shake,  as 
though  to  empty  something  out,  the  pain  and  irritation,  causing  him,  to 
thus  shake  his  head,  whereby  the  flaps  of  they  ear  get  bruised,  ulcerations 
form,  the  tips  become  sore,  the  inflammation  in  the  interior  lining  mem- 
brane extends  to  the  outside  and  from  the  shaking  and  scratching  is  formed 
external  canker. 

When  a  dog  shakes  his  head,  scratches  his  ear  with  his  paw,  and 
holds  his  head  to  one  side,  it  is  high  time  to  investigate  and  apply  remedies. 

The  acrid  discharges,  if  not  cleared  away  will  lead  to  irritation  of 
the  flap  of  the  ear,  the  flap  swells  and  looks  angry,  often  breaking  out  in 
sores  at  the  tips  and  edges.  This  is  external  canker.  The  peculiarly  of- 
fensive odor   of  the  ear  passage  is  a  sure  sign   of  internal  canker. 

Treatment. — Wash  out  the  ear  with  warm  water  and  soapsuds,  use 
either  Castile  or  Eberhart's  Dog  Soap;  rinse  with  clean  warm,  water  and 
peroxyde  of  hydrogen,  one  part  of  peroxyde  to  four  parts  of  water  by 
measure. 

Dry  out  the  ear  with  absorbent  cotton  swabs  made  by  rolling  cotton 
loosely  on  a  skewer  or  clean  piece  of  stick.     Dry  thoroughly. 

The  ear  is  now  ready  for  treatment,  and  here  is  my  remedy  which  has 
never  failed  to  cure  the  most  obstinate  cases.,  even  of  long  standing,  and 
I  give  this  as  having  proved  to  be  an  infallible  cure. 

I  cured  a  valuable  poodle  that  had  a  bad  case  in  both  ears  for  a 
year;  three  veterinarians  having  treated  the  dog  and  failed  to  cure  him. 
The  dog  was  then  shipped  to  my  kennels  and  I  sent  him  back  in  a  few 
weeks  entirely  cured.  This  was  the  worst  case  I  ever  saw  or  handled, 
and  I  cured  him  with  the  prescription  herewith  given: 

Iodine    16   grains 

Iodide  of  potassium    32   grains 

Mix  these  two  first  in  a  tablespoonful  of  water  and  then  add  one  pint 
of  pure  cider  vinegar.      Keep   in   bottle   corked   up. 

After  ear  has  been  cleaned  out  and  dried  as  directed,  take  your  dog 
and  lay  his  head  on  your  knee  and  pour  in  or  inject  with  a  rubber  syringe 
if  he  will  hold  still,  about  a  tablespoonful  of  the  remedy  into  the  ear  and 
gently  work  or  knead  it  in  for  a  few  minutes.  Do  this  once  a  day  only 
until  the  ear  gets  better,  and  then  every  other  day  is  often  enough.  You 
can  look  for  a  cure  of  ordinary  cases  in  a  week  or  less  if  treatment  was 
begun  promptly  at  first  signs,  neglected  cases  requiring  more  time. 

Here  are  several  other  good  remedies: 

Creolin 30  grains 

Sulphate  of  zinc ,  ,    16  grains 

Water    8  ounces 

This  one  should  be  injected  twice  daily  after  cleansing  the  ear  same 
as  |or  the  first  remedy  given. 

This  one  is  to  be  .used  three  times  a  day.  Cleanse  the  ear  with  in- 
jections of  equal  parts  of  peroxyde  of  hydrogen  and  water  three  timefe  a 
day,  then  injeet  two  t'easpoonfuls  of  the  following:  Sulphate  of  zinc  one 
dram,  sugar  of  lead  two  drams,  glycerine  two  ounces,  water  six  ounces. 

And  this  one  to  be  used  twice  a  day:  Sulphate  of  zinc  "ten  grains, 
acetate  of  lead  thirty  grains,  credlin  one-half  ounce,  glycerine  three  ounces, 
water  to  make  eight  ounces;  inject  a  tablespoonful  into  the  ear  twice  a 
day. 

The  discharge  from  the  ear  will  cause  sores  on  the  inside  of  flap,  so 
when  injecting  the  medicine  wash  these  sores  with  the  same.  My  iodine 
prescription  is  especially  good  for  these  sore  spots.  Injecting  with  rubber 
syringe  is  always  best,  if  your  dog  will  hold  quiet  and  not  resist  treatment, 
and  in  his  struggling  injurs  the  ear  from  the  syringe.  If  you  can't  con- 
trol and  keep  him  quiet,  then  pouring  it  in  will  do,  the  main  objection  being 

medicine  wasted.  I  find  very  little  trouble  in  giving  any  dog  medicine 
for  I  go  at  him  easy  and  gently,  talking  to  him  and  thus  giving  him  to 
understand  that  his  doctor  is  his  friend.  There  are  few  dogs  that  you 
cannot  talk  to  and  reason  with,  kind  treatment  very  soon  winning  their 
confidence.  You  can,  of  course,  tell  when  ear  is  cured  as  the  discharge  and 
offensive  smell  ceases,  ear  looks  healthy  and  dog  has  stopped  scratching 
and  shaking  his  head. 

It  cannot 'be  too  firmly  insisted  upon  that,  whenever  a  dog  is  suffer- 
ing from  ear  canker  or  from  any  eruption  or  skin  disease,  it  is  quite  neces- 
sary to  give  a  good  internal  medicine  as  it  is  to  apply  a  suitable  external 
lotion.  The  only  blood  medicine  known  to  many  dog  fanciers  is  sulphur. 
A  new  prescription,  therefore,  may  not  be  out  of  place  here.  The  follow- 
ing may  be  made  up  into  pills,  and  will  prove  an  excellent  all-round 
tonic  and  blood  purifier.     Take  of: 

Sulphate  of  iron    (dried)    12   grains 

Sulphate    of   quinine    6   grains 

Bicarbonate  of  soda    (dried)    24   grains 

Liquorice    Root    Powder    and    Extract    of    Gentian — Sufficient    of    each    to 

form  a  suitable  mass. 

Divide  the  above  Into  twelve  pills,  one  of  which  morning  and  night 
will  do  for  a  dog  of  20  lbs.  More  or  less  in  proportion  for  other  dogs. 
Or  Dent's  or  Clayton's  Blood  Purifying  Pills  are  also  both  good  to  use, 
in  old  or  very  bad  cases.  This  cannot  be  done  with  one  box  perhaps,  any 
more  than  you  could  cure  yourself  with  a  single  bottle  of  spring  medi- 
cine if  your  blood  was  out  of  order,  so  keep  up  treatment  until  desired 
result  has  been  accomplished. 

Ear  Canker,  External. — This  generally  follows  or  appears  in  connec- 
tion with  internal  canker,  due  to  the  poisonous  discharge  from  ear,  caus- 
ing sores  on  the  flap  or  edges  of  ear.  The  tears  and  scratches  from  briars 
and  thorns  in  working  hunting  dogs  in  close  coverts,  if  not  given  attention, 
may  also  set  up  external  caker.  Exteral  canker  is  a  sore  or  sores  much 
of  the  nature  of  a  cancer,  a  sore  appearing  on  the  outside  or  inside  of 
the  ear  which  eats  a  hole  through  to  the  other  side  if-  not  arrested.  It 
is  much  harder  t©  cure  than  internal  canker.  It  often  exists  as  a  se- 
quence of  inflammation,  ulceration,  or  suppuration  of  the  internal  passage. 
External  canker  often  starts,  especially- in  hounds  and  pointers,  or  any 
long-eared  dogs,  with  a  small  sore  that  gradually  eats  into  the  flap  until 
it  makes  a  slit  in  the  ear  that  continues  to  grow  deeper,  and  will  be  per- 
haps a  quarter  inch  wide.  This  will  be  scabbed  over  on  edges  of  the  slit 
with  a  thin  scab,  bleeding  a  good  deal,  due  to  dog  c'ontin»allv  shaking  his 
head,-  Make  a  hood  or  cap  of  a  piece  of  canvas  of  sufficient  length  to 
reach  around  the  dog's  head,  having  two  pieces  of  tape  running  through 
a  hem  at  each  side  lengthwise,  by  which  you  can  draw  the  cap  tight  enough 
around  the  dogs'  neck  behind  tho  ears,  and  aga'n,  just  above  the  eyes, 
tying  them  underneath.  This  hood  or  cap  prevents  dog  from  irritating  the 
ears  by  flapping  them. 


Treatment. — First  wash  and  dry  the  sores  nicely,  then  touch  the  sore 
edges  twice  a  day  with  following  solution:  Sulphate  of  copper  one  dram 
to  an  ounce  of  water.  Here  are  several  other  remedies:  Yellow  oxide 
of  mercury  15  grains  to  one  ounce  of  simple  ointment.  Mix,  and  use 
once  a  day  to  sores  after  having  first  cleaned  them.  Another  is,  if  any  of 
the  sores  look  "angry"  scrape  with  a  knife  a  little  blue  stone  into  fine 
powder  and  dust  the  ear  with  it;  or,  after  bathing  and  drying  nicely  touch 
them  with  a  point  of  lunar  caustic.  As  soon  as  you  have  cauterized  the 
sores  apply  a  damp  sponge  or  cloth. 

Quoting  Hugh  Dalziel: — "There  are  other  cases  where  the  whole  of 
the  external  ear  becomes  swollen  and  tender,  the  flap  thickened  and  filled 
with  fluid  between  the  skin  and  the  cartilage  or  gristle;  in  such  cases 
the  best  plan  is,  after  bathing  the  ears  well,  to  cut  them  with  a  lancet, 
press  out  the  bloody  matter,  and,  having  again  well  washed  and  softly 
dried  the  ears,  let  them  be  touched  with  the  following: 

Lead  Liniment. 

Goulard's  extract  of  lead    1   ounce 

Glycerine  and   carbolic  acid    %    ounce 

Finest  olive  oil    4  y2    ounces 

"Mix  the  two  first  named,  and  add  the  oil  gently,  rubbing  together 
in  a  mortar.  Shake  bottle  well  before  using.  In  getting  the  gly- 
cerine and  carbolic  acid  from  your  druggist,  I  mean  it  to  be  one 
part  pure  carbolic  acid  in  five  parts. 

"There  is  also  a  mangy  affection  of  the  ear  which  might  be  confounded 
with  external  canker;  in  such  cases  the  edges  of  the  ear  become  dry,  hot 
and  scaly,  and  hair  come  out,  but  this  is  not  ear  canker  and  should  be 
treated  as  mange  with  Eberhart's  Skin  Cure,  applying  it  twice  daily,  rub- 
bing it  on  until  ear  softens  up  and  gently  scraping  off  the  hair  with  the 
fingers." 

Enlarged  Joints — All  large  joints  are  not  diseased.  In  selecting  a 
pup  from  a  litter  the  big  jointed  ones  ore  to  be  preferred.  Enlarged  joints, 
from  the  want  of  the  hard,  earthy  materials  in  the  bone,  which  makes  them 
yielding,  so  that  they  cannot  support  the  weight  of  the  body,  consequently 
giving  away,  producing  deformity,  are,  however,  often  met  with,  caused 
generally  by  bad  food,  lack  of  good  water,  fresh  air  and  sunshine.  (See 
Rickets.) 

Ear,  Polypus  in  the — This  will  occur  sometimes  in  the  lining  mem- 
brane of  the  external  meatus.  Their  removal  should  be  left  to  the  vet- 
erinary surgeon. 

Ear,  Wax  Hardening  in  the Warm   water   injections   are   useful   and 

afterward   the  ear  should  be  carefully  dried;    or  better  yet,  glycerine  first 
put  in  hot  water  and  when  cool  enough  to  use,  inject  into  dog's  ear.     His 


 

head  laid  flat  on  one  side.  Or,  a  little  oil  of  almonds  poured  into  the  caviy  is 
good.  Either  should  be  kept  up  daily  until  the  wax  is  softened.  Another 
good  thing  is  one  part  spirits  of  wine  to  twenty  parts  of  lukewarm  water. 
Dry  afterward  with  cotton-wool  rolled  around  a  probe  or  piece  of  pointed 

stick. 

Enteritis — (See   Bowels,    Inflammation   of.) 

Erythema. — A  superficial  inflammation  of  the  skin.  Dogs  occasionally 
have  it;  not  often  a  serious  matter,  though  at  times  quite  obstinate.  The 
skin  peels,  leaving  the  part  tender  and  sore.  The  mouth  is  often  the  seat 
of  the  disease,  and  the  skin  finally  becomes  wrinkled.  Administer  a  purga- 
tive and  bathe  the  parts  with  a  saturated  solution  of  boracic  acid  lotion 
(non-poisonous). 

Eczema. — This  is  not  contagious,  and  in  this  respect,  differs  from 
mange,  which  is.  It  is  a  constitutional  trouble  and  no  external  application 
alone  will  ever  cure  it,  and  you  simpy  waste  time  and  medicine  giving  ex- 
ternal treatment  alone,,  for  to  insure  a  cure  of  this  disease,  internal  and 
external  treatment  both  are  required.  Neither  must  you  expect  to  cure 
it  up  in  a  short  time,  which  you  ran  do  in  mange,  for  eczema  requires  time 
and  patience  on  your  part — and  the  proper  treatment.  The  blood  must  he 
purified,  and  you  know  that  if  you  yourself  were  "taking  a  spring  medicine 
for  a  general  cleaning  out  and  getting  your  blood  in  the  right  condition 
you  would  not  expect  to  do  it  on  one  single  bottle  of  Dr.  Somebody's  Sarsa- 
parilla.  Eczema  requires  a  proper  course  of  medicine,  but  can  be  cured.  In 
this  disease. the  hair  sacks  or  follicles  are  the  "principal  seat  of  the  dis3ase, 
becoming  inflamed,  and  if  the  animal  is  a  white  one  the  hair  assumes  a. 
rusty  or  reddish  color  at  the  roots.  The  inside  of  the  thighs,  back  of  the 
forelegs,  Hie  elbows  and  belly  art  the  parts  first  affected.  Prompt  means 
must  be  taken  at  this  tinr?  to  check  it  up  or  inflammation  increases  rapidly, 
and  the  entire  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissues  will  be  involved,  the  hair 
drops  out  from  the  affected  follicle,  purulent  matter  exudes  and  pustules 
form,  which  break  open,  the  matter  from  them  running  together  and  form- 
ing scabs,  which  crack  open  and  bleed,  and  the  animal  has  become  a  pitiful 
and  loathsome   object,   emitting   a   very   disagreeable   odor. 

In  my  forty  years'  experience  in  handling  dogs  I  have  found  at  least 
fifty  cases  of  eczema  to  one  of  mange.  Any  skin  trouble  appearing  on  a 
dog  the  first  conclusion  of  so  many  is  that  it  is  mange,  and  here  is  where 
the  mistake  often  comes  in.  Eczema  is  curable  in  a  dog  the  same  as  in 
a  human,  but  patience  and  regular,  persistent  treatment  must  be  expected 
to  be  given  the  patient. 

'  In  every  article  on  eczema  given  herein  Eberhart's  Skin  Cure  will  do 
the  work  externally,  and  nothing  more  certain  to  use  for  the  external  part 
of  the  treatment,  in  lieu  of  any  others  advised  in  either  of  the  articles.  It 
is  also  safe  and  non-poisonous. 

It  will  require  a  month  or  even  two  or  three  months'  treatment  to  effect 
a  cure  in  eczema,  but  if  you  follow  treatment,  and  keep  it  up  faithfully,  you 


 

will  surely  be  rewarded  for  your  trouble  by  again  seeing  your  dog  as  lie 
should  be — in  his  usual  good  health  and  condition. 

A  couple  years  ago  I  found  out  something  new  to  use  internally,  for 
the  blood,  in  connection  with  my  skin  remedy,,  externally.  A  pure  white 
sulphur,  only  obtainable  of  a  homeopathic  druggist,  and  is  called — Sulphur 
12X.  I  succeeded  in  curing  up  several  cases  of  chronic  eczema  that  I  had 
failed  with  before.  One  was  a  Chow  Chow,  a  long-coated  dog,  that  was 
almost  bare  of  hair,  using  the  skin  remedy  once  a  day,  well  rubbed  in  with 
the  hands,  and  giving  him  morning  and  night,  mixed  in  his  food,  (as  it  is 
tasteless),  as  much  as  would  hold  on  a  silver  dime.  Sometimes  I  gave  it 
dry,  by  opening  mouth  and  dropping  it  well  back  on  his  tongue,  mornings, 
when  his  breakfast  was  dry  Spratt's  dog  cakes.  This  dogs  coat  came  out 
full,  this  part  mostly  due  to  my  skin  remedy,  which  is  a  hair  grower.  If 
no  homeopathic  druggist  in  your  town,  your  druggist  can  order  it  for  you, 
or,  you  can  get  it  from  me.  I  consider  this  valuable  treatment  for  eczema, 
as  so  far,  it  has  not  failed  to  cure. 

If  your  dog  has  skin  trouble,  find  out  whether  it  is  eczema,  or  one 
of  the  several  kinds  of  mange,  see  "Mange",. also. 

The  following,  on  eczema,  written  by  Dr.  F.  Holmes  Brown,  is  an  able 
article  on  this  subject: 

"Eczema  in  the  dog  manifests  many  of  the  same  signs  and  symptoms 
of  the  same  disease  found  in  man.  No  disease  in  the  whole  range  of  skin 
diseases  is  so  difficult  to  treat  properly.  In  eczema  in  the  dog  it  is  especially 
important  that  one  first  of  all  find  out  what  is  causing  the  disease,  then 
seek  to  remove  it.     In  that  way  only  can  we  hope  for  success. 

"Eczema  is  an  acute  or  chronic  catarrhal  inflammatory  disease  of  the 
skin.  In  the  dog  it  manifests  itself  in  two  separate  and  distinct  forms;  first, 
the  blotch  or  nervous  or  neurotic  form,  and  second,  the  red  mange  or  irri- 
tative form.  The  lesions  in  this  disease  vary  according  to  the  acting  cause, 
the  seat  of  the  disease  and  the  care  given  the  dog.  The  blotch  or  neurotic 
form  attaclfs  the  skin  on  the  head  and  along  the  back.  This  form  is  similar 
to  the  "milk  crust"  found  in  children,  and  li  due  to  much  the  same  causes. 
The  red  mange  is  that  form  in  which  the  skin  is  generally  red,  but  it  is 
more  visible  under  the  legs,  on  the  back  and  abdomen. 

"The  usual  form  of  eruption  in  canine  eczema  cinsists  of  a  large  num- 
ber of  small  water  pimples  or  vesicles  frequently  covering  a  large  extent 
of  skin.  These  are  formed  close  together,  forming  quite  large  water  blis- 
ters. When  opened  these  look  cellular  in  structure  from  the  many  small 
pimples  of  which  they  are  composed.  They  terminate  either  by  absorption 
or  rupture.  They  come  in  crops  and  remain  for  varying  periods  of  time. 
All  dogs  are  liable  to  attacks  of  this  disease.  Eczema  becomes  chronic 
after  repeated  attacks.  When  we  have  a  subdued  form,  there  is  a  greater 
tendency  to  crusting,  and  in  severe  cases  to  the  formation  of  pus.  In  the 
blotch,  lack  of  exercise,  constipation,  over-feeding,  injurious  foods  and 
indigestion  are  the  main  causes.  In  the  red  mange  form,  lack  of  assimila- 
tion, rheumatism,  gout,  and  external  irritation,  as  lice  and  ticks  act  as 
causes.  In  both  of  these  forms,  lack  of  exercise  is  one  of  the  most  impor- 
tant causes.  This  results  in  an  over-heated  blood  surcharged  with  the 
partly  assimilated  food,  and  in  nature  seek3  to  get  rid  of  this  excess  of 
effete  material  by  the  skin. 



"This  is  carried  off  by  the  exudation.  This  is  a  law  of  nature,  when 
the  ordinary  channels  are  clogged,  to  try  and  excrete  these  substances 
through  the  skin.  This  is  particularly  so  in  cases  due  to  rheumatism,  where 
nature  seeks  to  rid  the  system  of  the  excess  of  uric  acid  and  urates.  These 
substances  act  as  direct  irritants  to  the  skin,  and  set  up  a  catarrhal  inflam- 
mation. Washing  dogs  affected  with  eczema  is  to  be  avoided,  as  much  as 
possible,  as  both  water  and  soap  act  as  a  direct  irritant  to  the  already 
inflamed  skin.  The  sulphate  of  magnesia  or  soda  is  in  the  beginning  of 
treatment  of  great  value.  When  there  is  much  constitutional  disturbance, 
opium  and  calomel  in  grain  closes  are  indicated.  Benzoated  oxide  of  zinc 
ointment  in  the  milder  forms  is  of  great  benefit.  Tincture  of  arnica,  15 
to  20  grains  to  the  ounce,  of  an  oily  lotion  is  of  value.  Lotions  contain- 
ing salol  or  salicylic  acid  from  five  to  thirty  grains  to  the  ounce,  resorcin 
in  the  same  proportion.  Dusting  powders  composed  of  acetanilid,  salol, 
salicylic  acid,  or  resorcin  with  sterate  of  zinc  as  a  base,  is  of  value.  When 
disease  is  due  to  debility,  mineral  tonics  and  cod  liver  oil  should  be  given. 
When  the  disease  becomes  chronic,  stronger  remedies  must  be  used;  oint- 
ments containing  juniper  tar,  green  soap  and  sulphur  are  of  value.  The 
ointment  of  the  nitrate  and  ammoniate  of  mercury  are  much  used.  In 
cases  where  the  skin  is  especially  sensitive,  silver  nitrate,  1  grain  to  the 
ounce  of  water  will  often  effect  a  cure.  In  the  chronic  cases,  especially, 
iron,  arsenic,  calomel  and  quinine  are  to  be  used.  The  animal,  while  under- 
going treatment,  should  be  kept  clean,  and  give  plenty  of  exercise.  An 
eruption,  resembling  eczema,  may  be  induced  by  large  doses  of  mercury. 
The  skin  becomes  red  and  swollen,  then  forms  large  scales  and  hardens. 
This  eruption  is  generally  limited  to  the  limbs  and  scrotum.  Some  of  the 
symptoms  are  salivation,  loss  of  appetite,  eyelids  closed,  dullness,  offensive 
odor  from  the  skin,  and  rarely,  death." 

I  now  give  you  Dent's  article  on  Eczema,  written  expressly  for  thia 
book: 

"In  medical  nomenclature,  eczema  is  a  very  comprehensive  term.  It 
is  applied  to  all  diseases  of  the  skin  (except  true  mange  or  dog  itch),  and 
on  account  of  the  irritation  set  up  during  an  attack  of  mange,  it  is  generally 
complicated  with  eczema,  which  remains  to  annoy  the  dog  and  his  owner 
long  after  the  mange  mites  are  destroyed. 

"Dogs  are  particularly  subject  to  skin  diseases,  that  are  the  bane 
alike  of  the  breeder  keeping  a  large  number  of  dogs  in  kennels,  or  the 
single  house  pet.  While  true  dog  itch  is  common  enough,  ninety  per  cent 
of  all  skin  diseases  are  eczema. 

"There  is  a  close  relation  between  the  skin  of  the  dog  and  his  digestive  , 
organs,  and  a  deranged  stomach  will  quickly  find  expression  through  an 
eruption  of  the  skin;  any  poverty  or  plethoric  condition  of  the  blood  will 
also  be  expressed  in  the  same  way.  If  there  is  any  defect  or  unhealthy 
condition  of  the  digestive  tract,  and  it  is  called  upon  to  digest  unsuitable 
food,  it  is  only  a  question  of  time  before  poisons  are  introduced  into  the 
blood  that  will  produce  inflammation  and  eruptions  of  the  skin.  Strictly 
speaking,  eczema  is  an  inflammation  of  the  skin  due  to  the  causes  above 
mentioned,  and  numerous  others  such  as  old,  dirty,  damp  bedding,  lack  of 
exercise,  over-feeding,  starvation,  irritation  from  insects,  lice,  fleas  or  from 



true  mange.  In  most  cases  it  can  be  ascribed  to  a  disordered  condition  of 
the  blood  and  general  system. 

"Eczema  assumes  a  variety  of  forms.  In  one  very  common  form  there 
is  first  a  redness  of  the  entire  skin  with  a  dry  scaly  dandruff  that  flakes 
off.  In  another  form  there  is  an  eruption  of  small  distinct  pimples  or 
papules  that  do  not  always  break  but  can  be  easily  felt,  like  shot  under 
the  skin.  In  another  form  there  is  a  formation  of  scurvy  crusts  of  a  yel- 
lowish white  color  that  smells  like  mice,  and  underneath  this  crust  are 
small,    cup-shaped    ulcers. 

"Follicular  mange,  or  red  mange,  is  due  to  a  sort  of  vegetable  fungoid 
mite  that  lives  at  the  base 'of  the  hair  and  around  the  sebaceus  gland. 
It  turns  the  skin  a  sort  of  brownish  red,  kills  the  hair  root,  and  is  most 
commonly  found  along  the  back  near  the  root  of  the  tail. 

"In  the  commonest  form  of  eczema. there  will  first  be  noticed  a  patch 
on  some  part  of  the  dog's  body  that  is  inflamed  or  covered  with  pimples. 
These  pimples  increase  in  size  and  become  a  vesicle  filled  with  a  clear  tur- 
bulent or  purulent  fluid.  This  sore  breaks,  the  fluid  escapes,  runs  over 
the  skin  which  it  irritates,  and  dries  into  scabs  which  mat  the  hair  together. 
The  inflammation  affects  the  hair  follicle,  the  hair  drops  out  leaving  bare 
spots,  and  there  is  a  constant  exudate  of  matter,  which  spreads  and  forms 
more  hare  spots.  The  skin  becomes  ulcerated  or  thickened  and  wrinkled. 
The  dog  is  tormented  by  the  intolerable  itching  past  all  point  of  endur- 
ance, scratches  himself  until  he  bleeds,  cannot  sleep  or  eat,  gets  no  rest 
and  becomes  a  mere  wreck  of  his  former  self. 

"Treatment. — As  previously  stated,  eczema  and  inflammation  of  the 
skin  are  largely  due  to  constitutional  causes,  and  there  is  no  specific  treat- 
ment or  radical  cure  for  all  cases,  and  the  owner  must  exercise  his  power 
of  judgment  and  reason,  and  possibly  try  two  or  three  different  preparations 
before  effecting  a  cure. 

"The  following  course  must  be  pursued.  First  make  a  change  in  the 
animal's  diet  if  he  is  being  fed  on  grains  and  vegetables  with  little  or  no 
meat,  give  him  an  increased  amount  of  meat  both  lean  and  raw,  with  little 
or  no  bread  or  vegetables,  and  vice  versa.  If  the  dog  is  fat  and  plethoric, 
generally  prosperous,  and  inclined  to  be  constipated,  give  him  a  good  laxa- 
tive pill  every  night  and  fast  for  twenty-four  hours.  If  he  is  thin  and  un- 
thrifty give  cod  liver  oil  emulson  with  from  two  to  five  grains  of  the 
sulphate  or  iron  of  Sergeant's  Iron  and  Arsenic  Pills.  The  fat  plethoric 
dog  should  have  a  blood  purifying  and  cooling  pill  twice  a  day  for  some 
time.  Clayton's  Blood  Cooling  Pill  is  very  good,  or  the  following  prescrip- 
tion: 

Flower   of  sulphur    2   ounces 

Cream   of  tartar 3   ounces 

Bromide  of  potassium   3   drams 

Mix  and  divide  into  eighteen  powders  and  give  one  in  the  morning. 

"The  blood  purifying  and  cooling  pills  mentioned  are  th»  best  thing 
to   use,  handy  and  easier  to  give. 



"Besides  the  mange  and  eczema  cures  on  the  market  the  following 
are  useful  in  cases  where  there  is  great  irritation  with  little  or  no  eruption: 

Plumbi   acet %  dram 

Soda  bibarat 1  %  drams 

Glycerin     2  ounces 

Aqua    camphor     , 8  ounces- 

Lanolin     4  ounces 

Lard     4  ounces 

Salicylic    acid     1  ounce 

Boracic   acid    1  ounce 

Apply  once  a  day  and  wash  every   week  and  repeat. 

Another  is: 

Carbolized    glycerin 1   ounce. 

Laudanum    2   ounces 

Carbonate  of  potash    2   drams 

Apply  all  over,  twice  a  day,  wash  twice  a  week. 

Another  is: 

Boracic   acid    1    ounce 

Salicyclic    acid     1  ounco 

Laudanum     1    ounce 

Whale    oil 14    ounces 

Apply  all  over  twice  a  day  and  wash  once  a  week  with  Eberhart's 
Soap." 

"The  Kennelman"  has  this  to  say  of  Eczema,  published  in  American 
Stock-Keeper: 

"Obstinate  cases  of  eczema  are  most  distressingly  aggravating  to  the 
kennel  owner.  In  a  majority  of  instances  this  condition  arises  from  the 
continued  use  of  starchy  foods.  When  I  he  symptoms  appear — pustulous 
formations  at  the  roots  af  the  hair,  after  a  preliminary  redness  of  the 
skin  and  wet  oozy  sores  that  appear  to  the  size  of  a  half  dollar  in  a  night, 
the  diet  should  be  attended  to.  Lean,  raw  meat  must  be  fed  almost  ex- 
clusively. Then  the  blood  must  be  purified,  and  exercise  given  freely.  A 
handy  preparation  that  will  be  found  excellent  as  a  general  cleanser  and 
preventive  is  a  mixture  of  equal  parts  (not  weights)  of  Epsom  salts,  cream 
of  tartar  and  sulphur  lac;  a  pinch  every  morning,  in  quantity  according 
to  the  size  of  the  dog,  dropped  on  the  tongue  for  a  week  will  do  good. 
It  is  a  remedial  agent  that  is  useful  at  any  time.  In  bad  chronic  cases 
this  mixture  will  do  well — one  drop  of  fluid  extract  of  colchicum  and  five 
grains  of  sulphate  of  soda,  three  times  daily  in  a  capsule;  feed  raw  beef 
and  no  cereal  food.  Apply  to  the  sores  equal  parts  of  oil  of  tar  and  alcohol, 
or  Eberhart's  Skin   Cure. 

"Another  good  thing  is  the  liver  of  sulphur  one  buys  in  pound  tins 


n  diseases 

(Sulph.  Potass).  Dissolve  a  teaspoonful  in  a  quart  of  warm  water  and 
apply  at  once  to  the  sores,  in  fact,  the  whole  body  should  be  covered  with 
it.  If  a  dip  is  required  for  several  dogs  make  the  solution  of  the  above 
proportions;  if  too  strong  the  hair  will  be  burned  off.  This  is  a  won- 
derfully good  remedy  for  puppy  rash  that  develops  often  after  puppies 
leave  the  mother;   and  if  the  puppy  licks  itself  all  the  better." 

Fatness,  Excessive. — This  should  never  exist  in  any  dog  and  need  not 
providing  it  has  been  fed  properly  and  sufficiently  exercised.  It  is  a  hard 
thing  to  do  to  reduce  a  dog,  especially  an  old  one,  after  it  has  been  allowed 
to  get  into  this  condition.  However,  some  dogs  are  predisposed  to  obesity, 
and  to  put  on  fat  even  when  on  a  meagre  diet;  such  being  the  case  with 
a  great  many  pugs  and  different  species  of  spaniels.  A  certain  amount  of 
fat  is  not  only  a  sign  of  health,  but  also  desirable,  as  it  is  the  store  of  fuel 
that  nature  lays  up  to  meet  future  exigencies;  but  an  excess  of  fat  con- 
stitutes a  morbid  and  diseased  state  of  the  body. 

A  .common  effect  of  excessive  fat  is  to  set  up  skin  disease,  with  dis- 
charge therefrom,  which  is  Nature's  means  of  ridding  the  system  of  the 
superfluous  matter.  Or  the  fat  accumulates  round  vital  organs,  interfering 
with  the  animal's  respiration,  making  the  breathing  labored,  wheezy,  and 
asthamatical,  painful  to  the  sufferer,  which  blows  and  pants  on  the  slightest 
extra  exertion,  and  most  distressing  to  the  owner.  In  bitches  not  allowed 
to  breed,  fat  accumulates  round  the  kidneys  and  ovaries;  the  heart  also 
becomes  surrounded  with  fat,  and  what  is  called  fatty  infiltration  or  fatty 
degeneration  ensues,  which  may  cause  sudden  death. 

Causes. — It  is  caused  by  confinement,  lack  of  exercise  and  an  over 
abundance  of  food  of  too  rich  a  quality  of  fat-producing  material.  Castrat- 
ing of  dogs  and  spaying  of  bitches — and  I  don't  believe  it  right  to  do  either 
— will  cause  accumulations  of  adipose  matter,  as  it  takes  from  the  dog 
one  of  the  organs  of  secretion,  and  all  dogs  that  refuse  sexual  connection 
will  become  obese.  All  dogs  should  be  allowed  Nature's  privilege  at  least 
a  few  times  during  their  lives. 

Treatment. — Give  a  brisk  purgative  two  or  three  times  a  week  and 
give  two  to  three  grains  of  the  iodide  of  potash  in  water  twice  a  day  after 
feeding.  Gradually  decrease  the  allowance  of  food  and  feed  only  stale 
bread,  dog  biscuit  or  crackers,  dry  if  they  will  eat  them,  if  not  moisten 
with  a  very  little  milk  or  thin  soup;  do  not  feed  grease,  fat,  potatoes  or 
sweets  of  any  kind.  As  the  food  is  decreased  slowly  increase  the  amount 
of  exercise,  and  as  the  animal  gradually  comes  into  form  omit  the  purga- 
tives and  feed  raw  lean  beef,  chopped  fine — gradually  increasing  the 
amount. 

Fleas. — These  are  familiar  to  every  one,  I  mean  the  fleas  that  are 
found  on  dogs,  and  no  description  is  really  necessary.  There  are  a  number 
of  good  remedies. 

"Eberhart's  Dog  Soap"  is  the  easiest  and  surest  remedy  for  fleas  of  any- 
thing made  and  much  less  trouble  to  use.  All  your  dog  needs  is  a  good 
shampoo  with  this  soap  swice,  twenty-four  hours  apart.  After  applying  it 
thoroughly  all  over  the  dog,  not  missing  a  spot,  or  you  leave  some  fleas 


 

that  will  be  heard  from,  then  rinse  the  dog  in  lukewarm  water  and  dry 
thoroughly  with  rough  towels.  There  is,  however,  nothing — unless  you 
would  keep  some  preparation  on  the  dog  all  the  time  in  summer — that 
will  keep  fleas  off  of  a  dog  in  case  he  comes  in  contact  with  them  again,  as 
he  may  do  if  he  meets  another  dog  that  has  them,  when  your  dog  is  certain 
to  get  a  new  supply.  If  all  his  bedding  is  not  destroyed  while  being 
treated,  or  his  sleeping  box  not  thoroughly  disinfected,  he  will  again  get 
more  fleas.  The  best  plan  is  to  burn  all  the  bedding  he  has  used  in  his 
sleeping  box,  basket  or  kennel,  and  then  scrub  it  out  with  some  good  dis- 
infectant, getting  into  the  cracks  and  corners  with  Standard  Disinfectant, 
(see  advertisement  of  the  Standard  Disinfectant  Co.).,  which  will  do  the 
work.  Fleas  breed  every  twenty-four  hours,  so  that  in  using  my  soap  you 
must  give  the  second  bath  twenty-four  hours  later  to  destroy  the  young 
ones. 

Dogs  which  have  dense,  long  coats  are  subjects  of  special  delight  to 
the  fleas.  The  mouth  of  the  flea  is  specially  adapted  for  sucking;  the  wings 
are  rudimentary,  being  represented  by  four  minute  scales.  The  lavse  is 
a  footless  grub,  which,  in  about  twelve  days,  spins  a  "cocoon,"  (i.  e.,  an 
outer  covering  of  silky  hairs)  for  itself,  and  becomes  a  chrysalis,  from  which 
the  perfect  flea  emerges  in  about  a  fortnight  more. 

Here  are  also  some  home-made  remedies  that  you  can  try — they  will 
all  kill  fleas — but  my  soap  is  so  sure,  so  pleasant  to  use,  and  also  so  bene- 
ficial to  the  coat  that  it  seems  foolish  to  try  anything  else.  One  part  of 
oil  of  cloves  to  20  parts  of  methylated  spirit.  Directions:  Apply  all  over 
after  washing.  Or,  terebene  1  part,  glycerine  1  part,  methylated  spirits 
4  parts.  Apply  as  before.  Or,  a  lime  and  sulphur  lotion,  made  by  boiling 
16  ounces  of  sulphur  with  half  this  quantity  of  slacked  lime  in  a  gallon  of 
water,  the  whole  being  boiled  down  to  2  quarts  and  filtered.  Apply  a3 
above.  Or,  precipitated  sulphur  4  ounces,  powdered  camphor  1  ounce, 
powdered  resin  1  ounce,  terebene  1  dram.  Directions:  Mix;  dust  well 
into  the  hair. 

There  are  two  flea  powders  made,  both  are  very  good,  to  rid  .a  dog 
of  fleas,  if  you  prefer  a  powder  instead  of  a  liquid  remedy  as  is  often  de- 
sirable, especially  in  cold  weather,  to  avoid  the  danger  of  dog  catching 
cold.  Dr.  Clayton's,  (see  his  advertisement),  will  do  the  work,  if  used 
as  directed.  The  other  one  is  "Vermilax  Flea  Powder,"  considered  one 
of  the  best  made.  See  the  advertisement  of  Vermilax  Co.,  in  this  book. 
I  carry  this  Flea  Powder  in  stock,  and  can  send  it  by  mail  postpaid,  at 
thirty  cents  a  box. 

Fistula  in  Anus.— This  is  not  uncommon  in  pampered  and  over-fed 
dogs,  and  may  be  partial  or  complete.  It  usually  shows  as  an  opening  at 
the  sides  of  the  anus  .extending  upwards  to  the  gut,  where  it  can  be  seen; 
but  in  some  cases  there  is  no  external  opening.  It  is  caused  by  consti- 
pation, when  the  hardened  feces  abrade  the  surface  in  its  expulsion,  or 
neglected  piles,  resulting  in  ulceration;  or  fistula  of  the  anus  may  come 
from   a   wound   inflicted   on   the   part. 

Symptoms  of  Internal  Fistula. — The  dog  drags  himself  along  the 
ground,   and   the   voided   matter   is   highly   offensive  and   often .  covered   or 



streaked  with  blood  and  matter.  The  treatment  should  be  left  to  the 
veterinary  surgeon,  who  will  lay  the  sinug  open  and  apply  remedies  to 
set  up  healthy  action  and  close  it  up. 

Flatulency. — Is  not  very  common  in  adult  dogs,  but  oftener  met  with 
in  puppies.  It  is  unmistakable  evidence  of  indigestion.  For  immediate 
relief  the  treatment  should  consist  in  giving  to  a  20  lb.  dog  half  a  tea- 
spoonful  of  carbonate  of  magnesia,  large  dogs  a  teaspoonful,  in  a  little 
milk;  or  give  a  dose  of  castor  oil,  and  follow  with  5  gr.  to  15  gr.  of 
carbonate  of  bismuth  three  times  a  day  dry  upon  the  tongue.  For  per- 
manent  cure,    correct   the    indigestion.      See    Indigestion. 

Foreign  Bodies  in  the  Intestines. — This  is  another  cause  of  obstruc- 
tion in  the  bowels  to  which  dogs  are  peculiarly  liable.  Pieces  of  bone  "are 
swallowed  of  such  size  and  substance  that  they  pass  through  the  diges- 
tive organs  very  slightly  diminished,  and  getting  into  the  smaller  intestines, 
cannot  pass  farther,  so  that  feces  accumulate  and  harden  until,  if  not  re- 
lieved, inflammation  is  set  up.  Sometimes  stones  are  swallowed  and  cause 
obstruction,  and  this  will  at  once  demonstrate  the  danger  of  throwing 
stones  for  dogs  to  retrieve,  for,  in  their  eagerness,  they  are  apt  to  swallow 
them,  especially  if  small.  Wool  or  rabbit  fur  swallowed  is  likely  to  ball 
together  with  other  matter.     See  Obstruction  of  Bowels. 

False  Joint. — Is  found  where  limb  was  improperly  set,  or  the  dog  in 
unhealthy  condition.  It  is  the  non-union  of  the  bone  by  the  usual  osseous 
deposits,  instead  of  which  there  is  a  fibrous  connection,  the  union  of  the 
bones,  or  portions  of  them,  is  much  like  they  had  been  united  by  a  pi«ce 
of  India  rubber;  the  two  pieces  of  bone  can  be  readiiy  moved,  while  the 
limb  cannot  support  any  weight.  An  operation  is  often  attempted  to 
set  up  inflammation  of  the  parts,  and  induce  osserous  or  bony  deposits,  but 
experience  has  proven  such  operations  not  very  successful. 

Fatty  Degeneration  of  the  Heart. — Previous  to  making  a  brief  refer- 
ence to  this  diseased  state,  it  is  necessary  to  tell  the  reader  a  few  points 
of  importance  in  connection  with  the  healthy  heart  of  the  dog.  It  is  a 
hollow,  muscular  organ,  with  a  right  and  left  compartment  (the  ventricles). 
In  shape  it  is  like  a  cone,  th  apex  of  the  cone  pointing  downwards  and 
backwards.  The  base  is  made  up  of  two  compartments  of  the  body.  These 
large  vessels  serve  to  suspend  the  heart  in  the  chest  cavity,  says  Frank 
Townsend  Barton  in  British  Fancier. 

"The  blood  coming  from  these  vessels  first  of  all  passes  into  the  two 
compartments  at  the  base  (auricles),  and  from  these  through  valves  into 
the    compartments    first    mentioned,    and    called    the    ventricles. 

"The  weight  of  the  heart  varies  according  to  breed  and  age,  but  it 
has  been  estimated  that  it  runs  from  -3  to  7  per  cent  of  the  weight  of  the 
animal.  It  is  enclosed  in  a  bag  ,pericardium).  When  perfectly  healthy 
it  should  be  dark  red  in  color,  firm  to  the  touch  of  the  finger,  and  the  traces 
of  fat  running  down  the  various  grooves  upon  its  surface  are  a  sign  of  a 
well-nourished  orgaa. 


 

"Now,  when  it  is  affected  by  what  is  called  fatty  degeneration,  it  be- 
comes very  pale,  thin  and  flabby,  greasy  to  the  touch,  with  one  or  more 
patches  of  fat  upon  the  walls  of  the  ventricles.  This  is  brought  about  by 
the  muscle  fibres  composing  the  heart  being  changed  or  replaced  by  fat. 

"In  order  to  bring  about  this  condition  the  dog  need  not  be  fat  itself; 
in  fact,  a  heart  in  this  state  is  far  more  likely  to  be  found  in  a  dog  which 
is    thin    or   underfed. 

"Dogs  which  are  excessively  fat  externaly  generally  show  the  same 
internally;  that  is  to  say,  that  the  heart,  kidneys,  liver,  etc.,  may  be  com- 
pletely imbedded  in  one  mass  of  fat;  but  then  it  must  be  understood  that 
this  is  not  a  diseased  state  and  does  not  interfere  with  the  animal's  health 
so  long  as  it  allows  these  different  organs  to  perform  their  work.  It  is 
a  sign  of  over  rather  than  one  of  under  nutrition. 

"The  fatty  degenerated  heart  is  a  diseased  one.  This  is  not  technical. 
It  is  called  an  'infiltration,'  a  term  which  means  that  fat  is  formed  be- 
tween  the  muscular  fibres. 

"I  am  not  aware  that  there  is  any  symptom  or  symptoms  during  life 
which  will  enable  us  to  tell  whether  the  heart  is  in  this  diseased  state. 
An  opinion  can  only  be  purely  speculative.  Of  course,  the  heart  has  a 
weak  beat,  and  the  animal  is  easily  knocked  out.  Sudden  death  is  likely 
to  occur  either  from  failure  of  the  heart's  action,  or,  if  the  fat  is  in  the 
form  of  a  patch  upon  the  wall,  from  sudden  rupture  of  the  wall  at  this  spot,, 
whereby  the  blood  would  gush  suddenly  out  of  the  heart  into  the  bag 
containing  it,  ceasing  to  beat  at  once. 

"The  animal  must  be  prevented  from  any  severe  exertion. 
"It   has   been    stated    that    this    disease   is   common    among    pampered, 
asthmatical  pets,  the  truth  of  which  is  open  to  serious  doubt." 

This  is  perhaps  the  most  frequent  form  of  heart  disease  found  in  the 
dog;  it  is,  however,  seldom  diagnosed  during  life.  A  postmortem  will 
show  in  such  cases  that  the  fibres  of  the  muscles  are  dotted  with  small 
dark. spots  (these  are  globules  of  oil  within  the  sheath  of  the  fibre),  the 
heart  tissue  is  soft  and  breaks  down  readily  under  the  finger.  Cause  may 
arise  from  a  general  malnutrition  of  the  system,  or  from  senile  decay  due 
to  old  age.  The  organ  not  always  wholly  involved,  and  when  only  a  part 
is   affected    it   is   due   to   some   obstruction,    causing   local   malnutrition. 

Warty  Growths  on  the  Valves  of  the  Heart. — The  valves  of  the  heart 
are  sometimes  the  seat  of  small  wart-like  growths.  When  a  dog  has  been 
a  constant  sufferer  from  rheumatism,  in  such  we  occasionally  meet  with 
these  growths.  Their  presence  may  prevent  the  valves  from  working: 
properly,  or  one  may  be  whipped  off,  and  thus  block  the  circulation. 
Sudden    death   may   occur. 

Evertion  should  be  avoided  as  much  as  possible;  but  this  stite  can 
only  be  surmised  during  life,   as  in   the  case  of  the  former  disease.

Fractures. — While  fractures  are  not  of  frequent  occurrence  in  well- 
ordered  kennels,  they  belong  to  that  category  of  accidents  against  which 
there  is  sometimes  no  safeguard.  A  sudden  twist,  stopping  in  some  hid- 
den cavity  while  galloping  over  a  field,  jumping  a  fence,  or  from  a  car- 
riage (one  of  the  cleanest  breaks  of  a  hind  leg  occurred  to  a  foxterrier 
bitch  of  ours  while  jumping  off  the  carriage  seat  and  catching  her  hind 
leg  in  the  wire  rail  guard  at  the  end  of  the  seat),  so  one  never  knows 
when  such  accidents  will  happen.  Simple  fractures  are  so  termed  when 
a  bone  is  broken  into  two  pieces  only;  where  a  bone  is  broken  into  several 
pieces  it  is  termed  comminuted,  and  when  the  ends  of  the  broken  bone 
pierce  the  skin  it  is  a  compound  fracture,  which  is  the  worst  of  all  in  the 
piecing.  To  detect  a  simple  fracture  is  not  always  easy,  though  of 
course  the  other  two  conditions  are  more  or  less  self-evident.  In  the 
case  of  a  simple  fracture,  the  limb  should  be  taken  hold  of  above  the 
bruise  or  injury  with  one  hand  and  with  the  other  gently  move  the  lower 
portion  of  the  limb.  If  the  bone  or  bones  are  fractured  a  grating  noise 
will  be  heard  and  the  jar  of  the  broken  bone  can  be  felt. 

In  treating  this  condition  great  care  must  be  exercised  in  bringing 
the  broken  ends  together,  and  it  is  best  that  the  services  of  a  surgeon  be 
procured.  In  case  that  is  not  available,  or  a  home  cure  is  decided  upon, 
the  ends  of  the  fractured  bones  should  be  brought  opposite  each  other, 
and  then  splints,  well  secured  by  bandages,  must  be  applied  to  keep  them 
in  their  places  until  the  two  ends  are  joined.  This  is  generally  from 
three  to  four  weeks  in  the  case  of  a  puppy,  and  from  a  month  to  six 
weeks  in  a  matured  dog.  If  the  case  is  not  attended  to  immediately  after 
the  accident  the  parts  swell,  and  this  swelling  has  to  be  reduced  before 
any  attempt  can  be  made  to  set  the  bones,  and  cold  water  or  ice  applied 
to  the  swelling  will  easily  reduce  it.  Before  applying  the  splints  it  is 
necessary  to  wind  a  bandage  around  the  limb  two  or  three  times  from 
the  bottom  to  the  top,  as  this  has  the  effect  of  preventing  the  splints 
from  causing  unnecessary  irritation.  The  splints,  which  are  best  made 
of  wood  of  about  one-sixteenth  of  an  inch  in  thickness,  of  sufficient  length 
to  extend  over  the  whole  straight  surface  of  the  limb,  should  be  four  in 
number,  viz.,  one  for  the  front  of  the  leg,  one  for  the  back  and  one  for 
either  side  of  it,  and  they  should  be  just  wide  enough  to  cover  the  part 
of  the  leg  on  Which  they  are  placed.  Before  applying  them,  the  inside 
of  each  should  be  smeared  with  hot  pitch,  cobbler's  wax  or  some  such 
6ubstance,  so  that  they  will  adhere  to  the  bandage  and  not  slip,  and  then 
another  bandage,  which  should  be  of  considerable  length  (about  six  yards 
long)  and  one  inch  and  a  half  to  two  inches  wide,  and  which  has  been 
previously  soaked  in  a  thick  solution  of  gum  or  common  starch,  should  be 


 

wound  round  the  limb  from  bottom  to  top.  The  object  of  the  starch  or 
gum  solution  is  to  give  additional  support,  which  it  does  when  it  gets  stiff 
and  hardens.  After  the  operation  the  dog  should  be  put  into  a  quiet  place 
— a  large  hamper  or  crate  does  very  well — so  that  he  can  rest  and  not 
move  about;  but  it  often  happens  that  the  next  day  the  part  of  the  limb 
below  the  bandage  is  found  to  be  swollen;  if  so  the  latter  should  be 
loosened  for  a  short  time,  but  it  must  be  tightened  again  when  the  swell- 
ing  subsides. 

The  above  treatment  is  of  course  only  advised  in  the  case  of  simple 
fractures  where  an  amateur  may  indulge  his  surgical  skill. 

Fits. — Dalziel  so  fully  and  ably  handles  this  subject  that  I  give  his 
article  entire,  as  it  covers  the  whole  ground.  I  have  been  governed  by 
his  ideas  in  treating  many  cases  and  the  success  I  had  leads  me  to  endorse 
his  treatment: 

"Fits  are  of  common  occurrence,  especially  in  puppies — fortunately 
those  that  are  of  a  dangerous  and  fatal  character  are  the  most  rare;  they 
often  cause  needless  alarm,  but  the  dog  suffering  from  a  fit  of  whatever 
kind  is  not  an  object  to  be  frightened  at,  but  to  be  commiserated  and 
helped,  and  this  requires  freedom  from  a  fear  for  which  there  is  no  just 
reason.  Fits  are  of  many  kinds,  and  may  be  classified  as  apoplectic  fits, 
distemper  fits,  fits  from  teething,  fits  from  worms,  and  suckling  fits,  and 
other  causes  of  excitement  are  known  to  produce  them,  even  high  notes 
of  music,  to  which  some  dogs  show  a  strong  objection  and  are  decidedly 
harmful. 

Apoplectic  Fits  are  caused  by  pressure  on  the  brain  from  distended 
blood-vessels  or  effusions  of  blood.  The  subjects  of  attack  are  generally 
those  dogs  that  are  kept  in  idleness  and  over-fed,  and  the  attack  may  be 
the  result  of  the  animal  over-loading  the  stomach  with  food  difficult  of 
digestion.  The  symptoms  are  loud,  labored  breathing;  the  dog  lies  mo- 
tionless on  its  side  in  a  state  of  insensibility — there  is  no  frothing  at 
the  mouth  or  champing  of  the  jaws,  but  the  eyes  are  fixed  and  often  blood- 
shot. Such  cases  are  usually  fatal,  and  death  is  frequently  instantan- 
eous. Prompt  bleeding  is  the  most  likely  means  of  saving  the  patient; 
and  then,  soon  as  sufficiently  recovered,  a  strong  purge  should  be  given, 
or  clysters  administered.  Should  these  means  prove  successful,  it  will 
be  necessary  to  use  extreme  care  to  prevent  a  recurrence  of  the  fit.  The 
dog's  diet  must  be  carefully  regulated,  sufficient  healthful  exercise  al- 
lowed, or  compelled,  if  need  be,  and  occasional  doses  of  cooling  medicine 
given.  Clayton's  or  Dent's  Blood  Cooling  Pills  will  be  just  the  thing  to 
give.     Apoplexy  in   the  dog  is  not  often  seen  in  practice. 

Distemper  Fits  are  caused  by  congestion  or  inflammation  of  the  brain, 
and  often  prove  fatal. 

Epileptic  Fits  are  not  dangerous,  but  of  very  common  occurrence, 
especially  during  the  heated  term,  and  generally  happen  when  the  dog  is 
at  exercise — sometimes  in  the  case  of  pointers  they  are  seized  when  on 


 

the-  point,  doubtless  from  the  undue  excitement  produced.  When  the 
dog  is  attacked  he  is  first  observed  to  tremble  on  his  legs,  and  on  trying 
to  run  on  he  staggers  and  falls  down  on  his  side,  frequently  uttering  a 
low  moan.  Struggling  to  his  feet  he  attempts  to  move,  only  to  repeat  the 
fall,  when  he  lies  stupefied  and  insensible.  The  legs  and  the  whole  mus- 
cular system  are  violently  convulsed,  the  clog  froths  at  the  mouth,  the 
head  is  violently  moved,  often  knocked  against  the  ground,  the  jaws  are 
champed  together,  and  sometimes  the  tongue  gets  lacerated  between  the 
teeth,  and  the  froth  from  his  mouth  becomes  tinged  with  blood;  the 
breathing  during  the  fit  is  labored  and  irregular.  The  fit  generally  lasts 
several  minutes.  When  the  convulsions  have  subsided,  the  dog  raises 
his  head,  opens  his  eyes  with  a  look  of.surpri.se,  and  very  shortly  runs 
about  as  if  nothing  had  happened. 

The  treatment  during  an  epileptic  fit  is  to  generally  carry  the  dog  to 
a  dry  place  where  there  is  some  soft  material  so  that  he  cannot  hurt 
himself  in  his  struggles.  As  soon  after  as  possible  give  him  a  dose  of 
Anti-spasmodic  Drops:  Compound  spirits  of  sulphuric  ether  (known  as 
Hoffman's  anodyne),  and  tincture  of  opium  (laudanum),  equal  parts. 
(Keep  well  corked  and  cool.)  Dose  for  15  to  35  lb.  dog  would  be  a 
teaspoonful  in  two  tablespoonfuls  of  milk.  Larger  dogs  nearly  a  dessert- 
spoonful as  a  dose — and  leave  him  quiet  in  a  warm,  comfortable  kennel. 
Endeavor  to  ascertain  the  cause  of  the  fit.  If  from  over-feeding,  reduce 
the  diet  and  give  gentle  exercise,  and,  if  need  be,  repeated  doses  of  cool- 
ing medicine;  3  gr.  of  bromide  of  potash  for  a  20  lb.  to  40  lb.  clog  twice 
a  clay  in  water  for  a.  week  will  be  beneficial  to  dogs  predisposed  to  epi- 
lepsy. 

Suckling  Fits  are  produced  by  exhaustion  consequent  on  the  bitch 
having  too  many  pups  left  on  her.  She  lies  or  falls  down  breathing  heavily, 
becomes  insensible,  and  is  frequently  much  convulsed.  Remove  all  the 
pups  but  one  or  two,  which  must  meanwhile  be  fed  on  the  bottle,  or  by 
spoon,  condensed  milk — a  little  at  a  time  but  often — and  let  the  mother 
have  a  generous  diet,  and  if  much  reduced  give  Clayton's  or  Dent's  Con- 
dition  Pills  for  a  week   or  so. 

Fits    from    Distemper The    following    is    from    the    American    Field 

and  is  prescribed  for  by  Dent,   their  veterinarian: 

"I  have  an  English  setter  bitch,  twenty  months  old,  which  has  dis- 
temper. I  thought  her  about  over  it,  when  a  few  days  ago  she  had  a  fit  • 
which  lasted  about  3  minutes;  she  got  up  and  seemed  scared,  had  a  wild 
look  in  her  eyes  and  seemed  unable  to  see  well.  She  has  those  fits  now 
once  or  twice  a  day  and  is  very  weak,  but  eats  well,  though  hardly  able  to 
stand  up.  The  fits  she  has.  now  are  of  shorter  duration  but  she  seems 
much  weaker  just  after  one;  she  has  a  fit  soon  after  she  begins  to  eat 
and  is  disturbed  every  morning;  after  she  gets  over  it  she  will  finish  her 
breakfast  of  soup  and  rice  or  milk.  Will  she  necessarily  die  or  is  she 
incurable?  I  have  had  a  good  deal  of  experience  with  distemper  and 
have  lost  eight  four-months-old  puppies  this  Fall,  but  I  have  never  lost 
any  as  old  as  this  one.     Ans—  Give  twenty  grains  of  the  bromide  of  soda 


 

and   one-thirtieth   of  a   grain   of  arsenic   three   times  a   day;    w«   think  she 
will  recover.-" 

Teething  Fits  often  occur  during  the  cutting  of  the  first  teeth,  but 
more  frequently  when  the  permanent  ones  are  being  irrupted.  Lancing  the 
gums  is  sometimes  resorted  to,  but  as  a  rule  a  little  opening  medicine  is  all 
that  is  needed.  Convulsions  are  frequently  present  in  these  fits,  as  also  in 
those  due  to  worms. 

Fits  Due  to  Worms. — When  these  parasites  are  the  producing  cause, 
that  fact  may  be  ascertained  by  examining  the  fasces  voided  during  or  just 
after  the  fit,  as  some  of  them  will  probably  be  seen.  Or  the  presence  of 
worms  may  be  determined  by  the  symptoms  given  under  that  head,  and 
to   Worms   you   are   referred. 

Feet,  Sore. — Dogs  that  travel  very  much,  sporting  dogs  that  hunt 
over  rough  ground  or  short  stubble,  are  apt  to  get  the  pads  of  the  feet 
contused  and  worn  thin. 

Treatment  depends  on  extent  of  the  injury.  If  feet  are  only  tender 
and  slightly  inflamed,  bathe  with  cold  water,  afterward  applying  freely 
the  following  lotion. 

Tincture    of  arnica     Vs    ounce 

Tincture   of  matico    Vz    ounce 

Tincture    of  opium     1   ounce 

Acetic    acid  %    ounce 

Water   enough   to   till   a   wine   bottle. 

In  severe  cases  apply  a  poultice  of  half  bran  and  half  boiled  turnips. 
If  the  inflammation  is  great,  and  the  feet  become  swollen,  hot  and  pain- 
ful, so  that  the  dog  cannot  stand,  the  general  health  suffers,  as  fever- 
ishness  and  loss  of  appetite  will  reduce  his  strength;  matter  will  form 
in  his  feet  or  perhaps  his  soles  will  slough  off. 

In  such  extreme  cases,  add  linseed  meal  to  the  other  ingredients  and 
pour  a  little  olive  oil  over  its  surface.  The  dog-  should  have  a  mild  aperient 
and  a  dose  of  the  following  fever  mixture: 

Powdered    nitre     1   dram 

Sweet    spirits    of   nitre    ' %    ounce 

Mindererus   spirits    1 V2   ouncs 

Wine   of   antimony    1   dram 

Water     4   ounces 

Dose  for  a  30  lb.  to  50  lb.  dog  would  be  a  tablespoonful  every  four  hours  in 
a  little  gruel. 

Dog  should  be  kept  on  a  light  diet.  Sometimes,  for  more  speedy  relief, 
it  is  well  to  let  the  water  out  with  a  lancet,  and  in  all  respects  these  cases 
should  be  treated  as  ulcers. 



Goitre,  or  Bronchocelc — This  term  is  applied  to  a  swelling  or  lump 
that  appears  on  the  front  part  of  the  neck,  known  as  the  thyroid  gland. 
It  is  soft  and  elastic  to  the  touch,  and  appears  to  give  no  pain  except  when 
treatment  is  neglected  and  it  increases  to  such  a  size  as  to  interfere  with 
the  breathing.  It  is  especially  a  disease  of  old  dogs,  although  it  often 
occurs  in  ill-fed  and  scrofulous  puppies.  If  will  appear  in  a  night,  and  is 
sometimes  due  to  a  cold  caught,  which  settles  in  the  glands  of  the  throat. 
The  latest,  and'  I  have  found  by  having  to  treat  many  cases,  is  Iodin  Vasigin, 
full  strength,  which  apply  twice  daily,  rubbing  well  in  with  the  hands  as 
you  would  apply  a  liniment.  Another  good  remedy  to  apply  same  as  aboce, 
is,  Iodidode  of  Potassium,  one  dram  to  seven  ounces 'of  lard  (well  mixed). 
Aside  from  external  treatment  give  cod  liver  oil — from  a  teaspoonful  for 
a  20  lb.  dog,  up  to  two  tablespoonfuls  for  a  dog  like  a  pointer  or  St. 
Bernard,  three  times  a  day.  If  abscesses  form  they  must  be  lanced.  Dogs 
suffering  from  Goitre  should  be  extra  well  fed.  Painting  with  tincture  of 
iodine,  one  a  day,  is  as  good  as  'anything  you  can  do. 

Gatherings. — See  Abscesses. 

Gastritis. — Symptoms  very  pronounced  in  the  acute  form,  first  vom- 
iting, pain  and  tenderness.  The  position  of  the  animal  is  often  charac- 
teristic. The  animal  lies  stretched  out  on  his  belly.  There  is  not  the  same 
tendency  to  arched  back  as  in  colic. 

Here  is  another  "old  fashioned"  remedy,  that  I  have  found  most  suc- 
cessful. Get  a  dime's  worth  of  Slippery  Elm  bark,  cut  it  up,  pour  a  quart 
of  water  over  it,  then  set  it  in  another  vessel  of  water,  and  boil  'till  it 
makes  an  emulsion  like  mucilage.  Give  dog  a  tablespoonful,  (small  toys 
half  this),  three  times  a  day  before  feeding.  Feed  light,  soft  foods  for 
a   few  days.     Milk  peptonized   is  very  good. 

If  there  is  constipation,  Enemas  must  be  given. 

"Water  must  be  given  sparingly,  only  a  small  quantity  at  a  time  and 
quite  cold. 

Gleet. — Blaine  gives  this  name  to  a  discharge  from  the  prepuce,  but 
it  appears  to  me  the  name  is  misleading.  For  further  information  see 
Penis,  Discharge  from,  which,  although  not  perhaps  strictly  correct,  is 
adopted  as  being  the  most  generally  useful  and  readily  understood  heading. 
Professor  Law,  however,  enumerates  both  Gleet  and  Gonorrhoea  among 
the  diseases  of  dogs. 

Heart,  Valvular  Disease  of. — A  very  fatal  form  of  heart  disease.  The 
pulse  is  perceptibly  irregular  and  feeble.  A  post-mortem  will  show  the 
valves  thickened,  and  may  present  upon  their  surfaces  granulations  which 
feel  under  the  finger  like  minute  particles  of  sand.  Treatment  is  of  no 
avail;  but  to  prevent  sudden  death  all  undue  excitement  should  be  avoided. 

Harvest  Bugs. — These  come  in  summer  and  are  sometimes,  but  not 
often,  troublesome  to  dogs  as  well  as  man.     They  burrow  in  the  skin,  as 



does  the  parasite  in  mange.     Eberhart's  Skin  Cure  applied  twice  a  day,  as 
in  mange,  will  soon  destroy  them. 

Haematuria  (Bloody  Urine). — Dogs  have  this  trouble,  being  the  re- 
sult of  calculi  situated  in  the  bladder,  kidney  or  urethra.  Irritation  and 
inflammation  are  caused  by  these  foreign  bodies,  and  also  injure  the  mu- 
cous membrane,  producing  abrasions  and  superficial  bleeding,  the  blood 
being  passed  with  the  urine.  A  blow  across  the  back  may  also  cause  it. 
Upon  pressing  the  dog's  loins  pain  is  evinced,  and  there  is  also  a  certain 
amount  of  irritation  caused  by  passing  the  urine.  Blood  is  sometimes 
mixed  with  the  latter,  or  it  may  be  passed  independently  of  it.  Give'  10 
to  60  drops  of  liquid  extract  of  ergot  every  four  hours,  and  if  the  urinary 
passage  is  the  seat  of  the  injury,  inject  a  weak  solution  of  Condy's  Fluid. 
The  food  should  consist  for  a  time  of  Bovine  or  beef  tea,  with  egg  and 
milk    to    drink.      Under   no    circumstances    administer   a    diuretic. 

Hepatitis    (Inflammation    of   the   Liver). — See    Jaundice. 

Hernia,  Umbilical. — See  Navel  Hernia. 

Hiccough  arises  from  indigestion,  and  often  annoys  house  pets  that 
are  given  improper  food,  such  as  sweets,  etc.  A  wineglassful  of  lime  wa- 
ter in  a  tumbler  of  milk  to  drink,  and  for  a  20  lb.  dog  10  grains  of  bicar- 
bonate of  soda,  and  10  drops  of  sal  volatile  in  a  tablespoonful  of  milk,  will 
usually  prove  effectual.  Another  remedy  I  have  used  is  camplior  water 
(not  spirits).  Give  a  20  to  40  lb.  dog  a  teaspoonful  and  repeat  in  five 
minutes. 

Husk. — Dogs  are  subject  to  a  dry,  husky  cough,  associated  with  de- 
rangement of  the  stomach,  and  worms  are  often  the  originating  cause. 
The  symptoms  are  dry.  hot  nose,  disagreeable  breath,  inflamed  eye,  and 
increased  discharge  from  nose,  with  more  or  less  general  fever;  the  dog 
after  coughing  retches,  bringing  up  portions  of  frothy  mucus.  The  treat- 
ment consists  in  keeping  the  dog  free  from  damp  and  cold,'  feeding  on 
warm,  easily  digested  food,  and  the  administration  of  a  dose  of  salad  oil 
every  third  morning,  and  the  following  two  sets  of  pills,  two  a  day  of  each, 
giving  alternately: 

Pills  for  Husky  Cough. — Powdered  opium,  6  grains;  tartarised  anti- 
mony, 1  grain;  compound  squill  pill,  1  dram;  mix  and  divide  into  twenty- 
four  pills,  and  give  one  to  a  20  lb.  dog  twice  a  day. 

Tonic  Stomachic  Pills. — Pure  Sulphate  of  iron,  12  grains;  dried  bicar- 
bonate of  soda,  24  grains;  extract  of  camomile,  24  grains;  mix  and  divide 
into  twelve  pills.  One  of  these  is  a  dose  for  a  20  lb.  dog.  Not  infrequently 
worms  in  the  stomach  will  cause  husk;  if  so,  a  full  dose  of  ipecacuanha  wine 
to  cause  vomiting  should  be  given. 

As  I  am  writing  I  have  just  had  such  a  case  of  a  dry,  hard  and  in- 
cessant cough  in  an  eight-months-old  bull  terrier  pup,  which  cough  sud- 
denly appeared  without  any  apparent  cause,  the  dog  acting  and  seeming 
well,  only  for  this  dry,  hard  cough.     She  had  been  fully,  as  I  supposed  at 




the  time,  treated  for  worms,  and  thought  she  was  rid  of  them,  but  could 
not  account  for  the  cough.  I  was  ou  the  lookout  and  seen  her  have  a 
passage  of  a  bloody  and  mucous  nature.  Toward  night  I  concluded  it 
might  be  worms,  gave  her  a  dose  of  Sergeant's  Sure  Shot  after  she  had 
fasted  from  breakfast  till  supper  time,  and  the  result  was — finding  several 
small  thread  worms  in  her  passage  after  the  vermifuge  had  worked,  and 
here  was  the  cause  of  the  dry,  hard  cough.  I  followed  this  up  the  next 
morning  with  a  second  dose  of  "Sure  Shot,"  got  more  thread  worms,  and 
the  bitch  feeling  much  better,  wanting  to  eat,  and  her  cough  very  much 
better.  She  fully  recovered.  All  this  goes  to  show  that  you  must  get 
rid  of  the  Worms — as  they  are  the  cause  of  more  trouble  to  dogs  than  from 
any  other  cause  or  a  combined  lot  of  causes,  you  may  as  truthfully  say. 

Honie  Sickness. — This  is  often  seen  in  dogs  which,  from  some  causa 
or  other,  have  to  leave  their  home  and  friends,  and  reside  for  a  time  in  a 
hospital.  It  therefore  behooves  every  one  who  has  charge  of  such  dogs  to 
make  them  comfortable,  and  treat  them  as  nearly  as  possible,  consistent 
with  rational  and  medical  treatment,  as  they  would  be  at  home.  It  is 
absolutely  cruel  to  place  a  nervous  and  highly  sensitive  pet  dog  in  a  kennel 
surrounded  by  other  dogs  which  are  continually  barking,  or  to  give  them 
over  entirely  to  an  attendant,  which  is  too  frequently  done  in  hospitals, 
the  owner  of  the  establishment,  or  the  veterinary  surgeon,  only  attending 
at  intervals.  All  pets  should  be  taken  into  the  house,  or  have  a  special 
place  set  apart  for  them,  where  they  can  receive  personal  attention  and  have 
their  small  comforts  attended  to. 

Very  much  the  best  plan  is  to  not  send  your  pet  to  any  veterinary 
hospital,  but  to  keep  it  home  where  it  will  much  better  endure  the  ordeal 
it  may  have  to  go  through,  and  have  the  surgeon  come  there  to  treat  it. 

The  dog  will  be  happier  in  his  own  home  where  it  will  receive,  aside 
from  the  treatment  of  the  doctor,  the  kind  care  and  attention  it  could  not 
get  in   a  strange  place,   among  strangers   and  strange   surroundings. 

Hookworms. — The  process  by  which  the  hookworm  reaches  the  intes- 
tines is  most  interesting.  The  egg,  or  embryo,  is  deposited  in  fecal  matter 
within  the  intestines.  It  hatches,  or  develops,  after  being  exposed  to  air 
and  moisture,  usually  within  twelve  to  twenty-four  hours,  if  the  tempera- 
ture is  above  seventy  or  eighty  degrees  Fahrenheit.  In  about  eight  days, 
under  favorable  conditions,  such  as  being  on  warm,  wet  ground,  it  attains 
full  growth  (microscopically)  and  is  ready  to  infest,  which  it  does  by  boring 
through  the  skin  or  mucous  membrane  of  the  mouth  into  the  blood  canals, 
and  is  carried  along  with  the  blood  currents  to  the  lungs;  then  it  bores 
through  the  walls  of  the  blood  canals  into  the  air  sacs  and  crawls  up 
through  the  windpipe  to  the  throat,  and  then  passes  directly  to  the  in- 
testines, either  by  crawling  or  being  swallowed  with  food  or  water,  attaches 
itself  to  intestinal. membranes  and  begins  a  life  which  lasts  from  six  to 
ten  years,  unless  expelled.  It  subsists  entirely  upon  the  blood  which  it 
sucks.  After  it  is  attached,  it  grows  to  a  length  of  one-third  to  one-half 
inch,  the  female  being  somewhat  larger  than  the  male,  as  shown  in  illus- 
tration.    She  is  very  prolific  and  one  dog  which  is  infested  will  pollute  a 


 

vast   area    of   ground    by   reason    of   rains    washing    or   spreading    the    feces 
containing  thousands  of  eggs  or  embryos. 

The  presence  of  hookworm  is  hard,  almost  impossible  to  detect  with- 
out the  use  of  a  microscope,  unless  the  investment  is  quite  heavy,  then 
rapid  decline  is  noticed,  such  as  general  weakness  or  paralysis  of  the  legs 
or   hindquarters. 

Symptoms. — Rough  hair;  sometimes  a  cough;  as  a  rule  the  appetite 
continues  fairly  good;  languid;  eyes  become  bloodless  and  listless;  gums 
pale,  generally  a  creamy  white.  Excretion  sometimes  natural,  again  loose, 
again  of  a  dysentery  nature,  frequently  a  little  drop  of  blood  or  two.  This 
may  be  examined  by  the  average  layman  many  times  with  the  naked  eye 
and  from  the  fact  that  he  "doesn't  see  any"  the  conclusion  is  arrived  at 
that  the  dog  is  free  of  hookworm.  Many  times  a  dog  in  apparently  the 
best  of  health  is  infected  with  these  terrible  pests,  his  strong  constitu- 
tion overbalancing  the  damage  that  Mr.  Worm  is  doing.  This  won't  last 
always  and  sooner  or  later  he  will  pay  the  price. 

While  a  microscopical  examination  will  reveal  the  eggs,  it  occasionally 
happens  that  the  worm  itself  is  shown  in  feces  under  certain  conditions. 
Of  course,  a  microscopic  examination  of  the  feces  for  the  ova  is  the  one, 
absolute,   certain   way   of   determining   a   dog   having   them. 

This  worm  has  been  discovered  in  dogs,  cats,  foxes,  badgers  and 
human  beings,  adults  as  well  as  children.  This  is  mentioned  with  the 
view  to  impress  upon  all  interested  the  necessity  of  being  alive  to  the 
true  situation,  in  order  to  prevent  the  scattering  of  the  disease  and  to 
show  the  chances  of  it  being  scattered. 

The  worm  attaches  itself  to  the  walls  of  the  intestine  and  lives  about 
seven  years.  Remember,  kennel  owners,  the  worm  does  not  incubate  in 
the  intestine,  but  simply  deposits  its  thousands  of  eggs  there,  which  are 
passed  out  on  the  ground  in  the  excrement.  I  have  dissected  six-week- 
old  puppies  and  found  many  hookworms.  This  was,  no  doubt,  brought 
about  by  the  dam  lying  out  on  the  ground,  her  teats  being  attacked  by 
the  freshly  hatched  worm,  and  brought  to  the  suckling  puppies.  They  were 
treated  in  the  ordinary  way  for  worms,  but  this  will  not  kill  hookworms. 

If  hookworm  is  found  in  one  dog  in  the  kennel,  it  is  safe  to  assume 
every  dog  in  the  kennel  is  infected,  and  should  be  treated. 

The  following  most  valuable  article  is  from  The  American  Field,   writ- 
ten by  Edward  Martin,  M.  R.  C.  V.  S.: 

"Until  quite  recently  hookworm  disease  in  the  dog,  also  known  as 
pernicious  anemia,  uncinariasis,  etc.,  has  been  but  slightly  recognized.  This 
is  probably  owing  to  neglect  on  the  part  of  owners  of  dogs  and  veterin- 
arians to  make  careful  post-mortem  examinations,  and  again,  to  the  fact 
that  young  dogs  infected  with  hookworm  generally  carry  round  worms  and 
tapeworms,*  and  it  is  to  the  effects  of  these  that  death,  when  it  occurs,  is 
attributed. 

The  hookworm  parasite,  technically  known  as  Uncinaria,  inhabits^the 
small  intestines  of  dogs  and  foxes.  When  mature  they  attach  themselves 
to  the  mucous  membrane  and  live  entirely  on  the  blood  they  extract.  For 
the  purposes  of  this  article  they  may  be  described  as  an  extremely  fine 
round  worm,  white  or  grayish  in  color,  from  one-third  to  seven-eighths  of 
an  inch  in  length,  and  about  as  thick  as  a  fine  sewing  needle.    As  they  can 


 

seldom  be  seen  in  the  stools  it  may  be  advisable  to  describe  their  appear- 
ance on  post-mortem  examination  of  their  host. 

Dogs  dying  from  this  disease  are  generally  emaciated,  and  when  the 
patient  has  lingered  long  covered  with  bedsores.  The  gums  are  pale,  often 
spongy  and  ulcerated,  the  teeth  covered  with  a  dark  green  deposit,  with  a 
pronounced  odor.  On  opening  the  abdomen  the  mesenteric  glands  are 
generally  found  to  be  enlarged  and  dark  in  color,  due  <to  irritation  set  up 
by  the  poisonous  products  of  the  parasites.  The  outer  surface  of  the  stom- 
ach and  bowels,  as  a  rule,  show  little  or  no  changes;  in  aggravated  cases 
there  may  be  a  few  dark  red  or  purple  spots. 

To  find  the  parasites  the  stomach  and  bowels  should  be  taken  out  and 
slit  up.  The  parasite  does  not  often  occur  in  the  stomach,  but  may  be 
found  firmly  attached  to  the  wall  in  any  part  of  the  small  intestines.  The 
mucous  membrane  of  the  intestines  should  be  examined  in  a  good  light, 
inch  by  inch,  with  a  magnifying  glass,  and  if  necessary  washed  with  run- 
ning water   to   clear   away   mucus,   partly   digested   food,   etc. 

The  parasite  can  be  recognized  curled  up  in  a  spiral  or  lying  straight  in 
groups  of  four  or  five  to  a  dozen.  They  may  be  evenly  distributed  through- 
out the  small  intestine.  If  the  examination  be  made  shortly  after  death, 
each  parasite  is  found  firmly  attached  in  the  center  of  a  red,  inflamed  spot; 
wherever  the  contents  of  the  bowels  are  cherry  colored  from  blood  staining 
the  parasites  can  be  found  most  numerously.  The  whole  of  the  small 
intestine  is,  as  a  rule,  inflamed  and  thickened.  In  many  cases  round  worms 
and  tapeworms  are  also  present,  especially  in  young  dogs. 

Symptoms  and  Diagnosis  of  the  Disease. 

Hookworm  disease  has  been  looked  on  as  essentially  a  disease  of  sport- 
ing dogs,  especially  hounds.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  all  breeds  are  equally  sus- 
ceptible, and  it  is  simply  due  to  the  fact  that  sporting  dogs  are  generally 
raised  and  kept  where  the  conditions  favor  the  parasites,  that  it  has  been 
so  considered.  Dogs  at  all  ages  are  liable  to  become  infected,  but  grow- 
ing puppies  from  a  few  weeks  to  a  year  old  are  more  susceptible  to  the 
effects  of  the  worms. 

Symptoms  are  unfortunately  indefinite  in  the  majority  of  cases.  The 
dog  may  show  signs  of  worms  and  with  treatment  pass  round  worms  and 
tapeworms,  but  fails  to  pick  up  and  develop  as  expected.  Young  puppies 
become  anemic,  with  pallid  gums,  distended  abdomen,  injected  eyes  and 
a  hot,  dry  nose.  The  usual  treatment  with  vermifuges  and  purgatives 
produces  a  persistent  diarrhea,  the  worm  toxins  produce  convulsions,  coma 
and  death  in  a  very  few  days.  Older  dogs,  from  six  to  twelve  months  old, 
pass  through   these  stages  more  slowly. 

The  appetite  is  capricious  or  voracious,  the  gums  become  spongy  and 
bleed  easily  to  the  touch,  development  of  teeth  is  arrested — in  several 
cases  I  have  observed  crumbling  of  the  enamel  due  to  faulty  assimilation 
of  the  necessary  constituents  and  to  the  presence  of  a  foul-smelling  green 
deposit.  Chorea  may  develop  suddenly  and  progresses  in  violence  until 
death  occurs.  In  the  course  of  time  diarrhea  sets  in,  which  increases  in 
severity  until  blood-stained  or  tarry-looking  movements  occur  several  times 


 

in  the  hour.  Rapid  emaciation,  exhaustion  and  death  follow  in  a  few  days, 
once  dysentery  is  established. 

Absolute  diagnosis  can  only  be  made  by  microscopical  examinations 
of  the  stools.  This,  however,  involves  considerable  technical  difficulties, 
and  for  practical  purposes  may  be  counted  out. 

Treatment. 

In  nursing  and  newly  weaned  puppies  is  almost  out  of  the  question,  as 
drastic  remedies  cannot  be  used  safely.  The  remedies  recommended  by 
government  experts  for  uncinariasis  in  man  are  thymol,  male  fern,  oil  of 
turpentine  and  chloroform,  singly  or  in  combination,  followed  by  active 
purgatives.  In  the  dog  it  is  advisable  to  give  all  vermifuge  medicines  in 
capsules  or  coated  pills,  to  prevent  nausea  and  vomiting,  which  occurs  when 
medicines  are  given  in  fluid  form.  In  the  dog  better  results  are  produced 
by  giving  daily  doses  before  feeding  each  morning.  In  this  way  dysentery 
is  not  so  liable  to  be  set  up  as  where  full  treatments  are  given. 

Thymol  is  looked  on  as  a  specific  in  the  human  being,  but  is  a  most 
unreliable  drug  for  the  dog.  In  a  number  of  puppies  of  the  same  age,  weight 
,  and  condition  I  have  found  some  who  would  tolerate  large  doses,  while  in 
others  extremely  small  doses  would  produce  persistent  vomiting,  convul- 
sions and  death.  Extract  of  male  fern  in  combination  with  turpentine, 
chloroform  and  castor  oil  or  glycerine  is  much  safer  given  in  small  daily 
doses. 

During  treatment  tonics,  such  as  iron,  arsenic  and  strychnine,  arsenite 
of  copper,  etc.,  should  be  given,  and  to  sustain  strength  cod  liver  oil,  raw 
meat  and  milk  and  eggs  should  be  fed  generously.  To  control  diarrhea 
bismuth  subgallate  may  be  given  in  large  doses;  it  acts  as  an  intestinal 
antiseptic,  as  well  as  being  an  astringent. 

As  a  tonic,  instead  of  drugs  given  in  this  article,  the  writer  of  this 
book  would  use  Sergeant's  Condition  Pills,  in  all  cases. 

As  to  Prevention. 

Commencing  with  the  egg,  it  has  been  found  that  they  are  formed  and 
undergo  changes  while  in  the  oviduct  of  the  female.  After  being  passed 
out  of  the  dog's  bowels  with  the  stools  they  undergo  further  changes  in 
surface  soil,  the  time  occupied  depending  on  the  suitability  of  the  surround- 
ings, the  essential  features  being  moisture  and  favorable  temperatures. 
Where  conditions  are  favorable  the  eggs  are  hatched  out  in  a  few  days,  and 
after  the  embryos  have  undergone  several  moultings  they  are  ready  to 
infect  dogs  by  means  of  drinking  water  or  contaminated  food. 

The  important  features  to  remember  are:  (1)  That  the  eggs  are  hatch- 
ed out,  not  while  in  the  intestine  of  the  dog,  but  after  being  passed  out  with 
the  stools.  From  this  it  follows,  then,  that  every  individual  hookworm 
present  in  the  intestines  of  the  dog'represents  infection  by  a  single  embryo. 
In  other  words,  the  parasites  do  not  actually  increase  in  number  while 
in  the  dog's  intestines.  (2)  Moisture  is  absolutely  essential  to  the  hatch- 
ing out  of  the  eggs.  Drinking  troughs  and  contaminated  water  supply  are, 
therefore,  rightly  considered  as  the  chief  sources  of  infection. 


 

From  these  facts  it  can  be  seen  that  the  essentials  of  prevention  of 
hookworm  disease  are  absolute  cleanliness  in  every  particular,  especially  as 
regards  feeding  pans  and  water  vessels,  and  disinfection  of  all  excretions 
and  soiled  bedding.  When  an  animal  dies  the  body  should  be  buried  in 
quicklime,  or,  better  still,  cremated.  Above  all,  dampness  must  be  avoided 
in  every  possible  way. 

For  disinfecting  sleeping  quarters  dry  sawdust  impregnated  with  a 
reliable  disinfectant  is  of  great  value,  as  it  absorbs  moisure  and  when 
brushed  out  carries  away  and  destroys  the  eggs  of  the  parasite.  Woodwork 
may  be  whitewashed  or  painted  and  all  floors  should  be  cleaned  out  at 
least  once  daily.  Earth  floors  should  be  covered  with  boards  or  concrete. 
As  damp  soil  is  the  medium  in  which  the  embryos  develop,  outdoor  runs 
should  be  dressed  with  quicklime,  well  drained  and  covered  with  several 
inches  of  furnace  ashes  or  crushed  coke.  This  when  alternately  rolled  and 
sprinkled-  with  crude  petroleum  will  in  time  form  a  waterproof  asphalt- 
like surface  which  will  carry  off  water  according  to  the  direction  in  which 
it  is  sloped.  All  food  and  drinking  water  should  be  given  in  clean  pans, 
and  under  no  consideration  should  dogs  be  allowed  to  eat  from  the  floor 
of  sleeping  quarters  or  from  the  ground  in  the  runs.  To  prevent  mud  from 
being  carried  into  the  kennels  on  the  feet  of  kennel  men  or  visitors  where 
the  surrounding  grounds  are  liable  to  be  muddy,  board  walks  and  a  door 
mat  and  scraper  at  the  kennel  entrance  should  be  laid  down. 

Confinement  to  kennel  quarters  in  some  districts  seems  to  be  the  only 
safe  plan  to  avoid  the  disease,  as,  when  allowed  to  roam  at  liberty,  dogs 
will  drink  from  stagnant  of  surface  water  and  thus  become  infected. 
Suspected  cases  should  be  isolated  whenever  possible. 

Hookworm  disease  is  not  necessarily  nor  commonly  fatal  to  adult 
dogs;  in  fact,  in  Western  Pennsylvania  it  is  the  rule  rather  than  the  ex- 
ception to  find  a  few  hookworms  in  dogs  dead  from  other  causes.  It  is 
such  cases  that  constitute  a  danger  to  young  and  susceptible  dogs.  When 
the  method  of  reproduction  of  the  hookworm  is  taken  into  consideration, 
it  can  be  understood  that  when  reinfection  is  prevented  by  following  the 
precautions  suggested,  it  is  quite  possible  for  a  dog  to  be  entirely  freed 
from  hookworms,  provided  his  vitality  be  kept  up  to  the  highest  standard 
during  the  period  necessary  to  get  rid  of  the  worms  by  cautious  and  per- 
sistent treatment." 

Indigestion  (Dyspepsia) — This  means  that  food  taken  into  the  stom- 
ach is  not  digested  or  made  fit  for  the  nourishment  of  the  body,  and  that 
the  stomach  has  altogether  or  partially  lost  its  power  of  performing  its 
most  important  office.  This  is  caused  in  various  ways;  want  of  exercise, 
improper  food,  or  having' been  fed  irregularly.  Having  been  overfed  or 
having  fasted  too  long  will  produce  indigestion,  but  to  cause  a  serious 
attack,  the  causes  must  have  been  of  some  standing. 

Symptoms. — A  vitiated  appetite,  wholesome  food  he  will  turn  his  nose 
up  at,  or  eat  it  mincingly,  with  a  preference  for  filth  and  garbage.  Con- 
siderable thirst  it  present,  and  often  vomiting.  Flatulence  is  also  an  ac- 
companiment and  the  gums  become  inflamed,  and  breath  is  foul  and  offensive 
when  of  long  standing.     Indigestion  causes  many  other  forms  of  disease, 


 

following  neglected  cases — attacks  of  diarrhea,  sometimes  alternating  with 
fits  of  constipation,  as  derangement  of  the  bowels  are  almost  inseparate 
from  it.  Confirmed  constipation  sometimes  exists.  The  dog  may  become 
excessively  fat  and  suffer  from  asthma  accompanied  by  a  cough.  The 
dog's  temper  is  often  snappish   during  the  attack. 

Indigestion  is  the  cause  of  many  other  forms  of  disease,  which  are 
sure  to  follow  neglected  cases — derangement  of  the  bowels  being  almost 
inseparable  from  it.  Diarrhea  attacks  occur,  often  alternating  with  fits 
of  constipation;  or  confirmed  constipation  may  exist.  A  dog  will  often 
become  excessively  fat  and  suffer  from  asthma  and  asthmatic  cough. 

A  secondary  symptom  is  skin  disease  in  one  form  or  another.  In  treat- 
ing for  indigestion  tho  most  important  thing  to  do  is  to  remove  the  cause 
or  causes.  Give  a  sufficiency  only,  of  plain,  wholesome  food,  and  keep 
within  the  dog's  reach  a  supply  of  clean,  fresh  water.  Remedies  must  be 
given  according  to  existing  circumstances — diarrhea  for  instance,  treated 
as  recommended  under  that  head.  The  main  object  is,  however,  to  tone  up 
the  stomach  and  get  this  organ  again  into  good  working  shape.  Use  the 
following  aperient  bolus: 

Barbadoes    aloes    15   grains 

Jalap 1   dram 

Towdered  ginger 1    dram 

Castile    soap    2   drams 

Make  up  info  a  mass  and  divide  into  l-r>  grain  balls.  Dose,  one,  two 
or  three  balls,  according  to  size  of  dog. 

When  bowels  have  freely  acted  then  give  the  following,  twice  daily, 
until  health  has  returned: 

Towdered  rhubarb    1   scruple 

Powdered   ginger    1   scruple 

Extract  of  gentian    4   scruples 

Divide  into  twenty-four  pills  and  give  one  to  four  pills  twice  daily. 
If  much  flatulence,  put  a  little  bicarbonate  of  soda  on  back  of 
tongue  and  let  dog  have  water. 

With  careful  diet  and  exercise,  these  means  will  be  found  successful. 
Add  a  little  lime  water  to  the  milk  that  is  given  to  drink.  By  treating 
the  patient  thus  and  paying  strict  attention  to  his  dietary  and  exercise, 
the  disease  will  soon  yield. 

I  have  used  with  good  results  in  lieu  of  the  above  pill,  Clayton's  Di- 
gestive Pills  and  believe  to  be  very  good. 

The  following  article  I  found  somewhere,  and  as  it  is  worth  repro- 
ducing here  entire,  I  give  it  space  in  this  book: 

"As  in  man,  and  many  animals,  indigestion  in  the  dog  may  be  acute, 
chronic  and  passive.  In  acute  indigestion  the  attack  is  sudden  and  painful, 
and  is  the  result  of  an  overloaded  stomach.  The  disorder  is  called  chronic 
when  the  dog  suffers  for  a  continued  time  and  his  stomach  and  intestines 


 

are  in  a  weakened  condition.  It  is  active  when  the  attack  is  brought  on 
by  some  extrinsic  cause,  passive  when  it  is  the  result  of  some  other  disease, 
or  is  due  to  an  intrinsic  cause. 

"The  breeds  of  dogs  most  likely  to  be  affected  by  indigestion  are 
the  pug,  the  Japanese  spaniel,  the  black  and  tan,  the  greyhound,  the 
Yorkshire  terrier,  the  French  poodle  and  the  fox  terrier. 

"Pugs  are  probably  the  greatest  sufferers.  As  a  rule,  they  are  en- 
couraged in  laziness,  while  sweetmeats  are  fed  to  them  indiscriminately, 
so  that  it  is  not  surprising  they  should  become  fat  and  dyspeptic. 

"The  foods  which  are  richest  in  fats  and  those  which  are  prone  to 
fermentation  are  the  most  indigestible,  but  it  is  not  so  much  the  nature  of 
the  food  as  it  is  the  quantity  consumed  at  one  time  which  injures  an 
animal's  stomach.  Small  dogs  are  more  voracious  in  their  feeding  than 
large  dogs.  Some  dogs  never  or  seldom  get  a  bone  to  gnaw.  The  dog  is  a 
carnivorous  animal,  and  in  a  state  of  nature  he  lives  only  on  the  flesh  of 
other  animals.  As  he  swallows  his  food  with  but  little  mastication,  Nature 
has  provided  him  with  a  desire  to  gnaw  the  bones  into  small  pieces.  "When 
these  small  pieces  are  taken  into  the  stomach  they  bruise  and  lacerate  the 
food  until  it  is  made  thoroughly  digestible.  It  is  believed  that  70  per 
cent  of  the  cases  of  indigestion  in  dogs  are  due  to  their  being  deprived 
of  bones  to  gnaw.  Domestication  has  to  a  great  extent  modified  the  habits 
of  the  dog.  Some  pets  are  pampered  and  spoiled  to  the  degree  that  they 
will  eat  only  certain  foods,  which  must  be  fed  to  them  with  a  fork  or  from 
some  particular  dish.  Such  peculiarities  are  predisposing  causes  to  indi- 
gestion. 

"A  symptom  of  acute  indigestion  is  vomiting  after  feeding.  Later 
this  is  followed  by  general  dullness;  the  dog  isolates  himself  from  his 
friends,  his  eyes  .roll  with  an  expression  of  fear.  The  muzzle  may  be  dry. 
Rumbling  sounds  in  the  bowel  sare  heard,  accompanied  by  distension  of 
the  abdomen,  which  is  filled  with  gas.  If  the  animal  is  forced  to  move, 
he  shows  great  uneasiness  and  is  stiff  in  his  posterior  limbs,  his  back 
arched  to  relieve  the  tension  of  the  abdominal  muscles.  If  the  abdomen  is 
manipulated  he  evinces  acute  pain.  The  bowels  are  constipated..  These 
symptoms  may  continue  for  an  hour  or  more,  and  the  attack  may  pass  off 
as  suddenly  as  it  began,  or  it  may  last  for  some  length  of  time,  during 
which  the  dog  suffers  the  greatest  pain.  Then  the  pain  ceases,  his  eyes 
brighten,  he  becomes  cheerful,  and  off  he  goes  for  a  run,  apparently  per- 
fectly well. 

"The  symptoms  of  chronic  indigestion  are  the  same  as  those  of  the 
acute  attack,  only  they  are  less  intense  and  they  continue  for  days  at  a 
time.  The  dog  often  grows  irritable  to  a  state  of  fenzy,  and  will  run  about 
snapping  and  biting,  exposing  himself  to  be  shot  for  mad  by  some  over- 
zealous  policeman. 

"As  regards  treatment,  it  is  more  important  to  regulate  the  diet 
than  to  give  medicines.  Feed  the  sufferer  once  or  twice  a  day,  not  oftener, 
and  feed  him  sparingly.  Give  him  five  (5)  grains  of  saccharated  pepsin 
before  meals,  and  five  (5)  grains  each  of  subnitrate  of  bismuth  and  bi- 
carbonate of  soda  after  meals.  For  small  dogs,  such  as  terriers,  black 
and  tans,  Japanese  spaniels,  etc.,  the  dose  should   he  reduced  one-half," 


 

Inversion  of  the  Vagina — See  Uterus,  Inversion  of. 

Influenza. — This  is  an  epidemic  resembling  common  cold,  but  more 
severe  in  its  effects,  and  contagious.  The  causes  are  supposed  to  be  atmos- 
pheric cold,  and  damp  weather  in  spring  and  autumn,  which  are  the  usual 
seasons  of  its  appearance.  Influenza  is  not  to  be  dreaded  if  taken  in  hand 
at  once,  but  if  once  the  system  becomes  run  down  or  the  various  symptoms 
which  denote  the  disease  take  good  hold,  there  is  serious  trouble  ahead,  and 
leads  to  complications  which  deplete  the  kennel.  Even  if  a  cure  is  affected 
the  convalesence  is  long  and  subject  to  a  relapse  from  the  most  trivial  cause. 
In  the  first  stage  the  symptoms  are  dullness  of  the  animal,  loss  of  appetite, 
rigors  or  shivering  fits,  nose  hot,  then  cold,  increased  thirst.  Second  stage: 
A  discharge  from  nose  and  eyes,  which  at  first  is  mucoid  and  watery,  but 
it  soon  becomes  of  a  mattery  description;  the  breathing  becomes  acceler- 
ated and  the  conjunctival  membrane  red  (this  is  the  lining  membrane  of 
the  eyelid).  The  symptoms  in  these  first  stages  are  very  like  the  earlier 
symptoms  of  distemper,  and  most  people  seeing  one  of  these  cases  for  the 
first  time,  and  in  a  young  dog,  would  say  it  had  the  latter-named  disease. 
The  discharge  is  not,  however,  of  the  purulent  offensive  character 
that  denotes  distemper  and  the  disease  is  as  liable  to  attack  old  dogs  as 
young  ones.  In  some  cases  the  eyes  are  seriously  affected,  the  cornea  be- 
comes of  a  bluish  shade,  the  sight  is  affected,  and  in  some  cases  ulcers 
form.  In  the  latter  case  use  Eberhart's  Eye  Lotion  No.  2,  two  or  three 
times  daily. 

Distemper  is  gradual  in  its  development,  but  in  influenza  the  dif- 
ferent stages  develop  with  great  rapidity,  the  disease  running  in  some 
cases  on  to  complications  in  twenty-four  hours.  If  the  complaint  is  not 
checked  in  its  earlier  stages  one  or  both  of  the  after-mentioned  compli- 
cations may  set  in.  These  complications  are  affections  of  the  lungs,  and 
those  of  a  rheumatismal  character.  When  the  chest  complication  is  setting 
in,  the  breathing  becomes  more  accelerated  and  painful,  the  fever  increases, 
in  fact  the  symptoms  are  those  of  ordinary  chest  complaints;  and  these 
may  be  bronchitis,  congestion  and  inflammation  of  the  lungs  or  pleurisy. 
As  it  requires  the  skilled  practitioner  to  differentiate  one  class  of  chest 
disease  from  another,  it  would  be  useless  to  attempt  to  explain  to  the 
amateur  how  to  diagnose  this  for  himself. 

The  dog  should  be  kept  in  dry  quarters  and  away  from  draughts. 
The  treatment  should  be  similar  to  that  recommended  under  Cold.  The 
dog  will,  however,  require  still  greater  care  exercised  in  keeping  him 
warm  and  in  a  well-ventilated  place,  as  well  as  in  being  supported  with 
easily-digested  food,  such  as  strong  broth,  beef  tea,  boiled  milk,  bread,  etc. 
In  the  early  stages,  Hoffman's  anodyne  or  compound  spirit  of  sulphuric 
ether,  given  in  milk  three  times  a  day,  is  generally  beneficial.  Dose  for 
a  20  lb.  dog,  15  drops;  smaller  toy  dogs.  10  drops;  larger  dogs,  20  drops. 
Any  discharge  from  the  nose  should  be  encouraged  by  warm  fomentations 
and  making  the  dog  inhale  the  vapor  from  vinegar  of  squills  sprinkled  on  a 
hot  wet  sponge  or  cloth.  If  the  throat  is  swollen  and  sore,  slightly  blister 
with  vinegar  and  mustard,  but  do  not  apply  too  long. 

Feed  on  nourishing  foods,   strong  broth,   boiled  milk  and  bovine.     A 


 

few  drops  of  the  latter,  administered  frequently  in   milk,  is  very  strength- 
ening. 

In  convalescence  a  treatment  for  a  few  works  of  Eberhart's  Tonic 
Pill,  (which  contain  no  arsenic  or  "dope")  will  be  of  great  benefit  in 
building  the  dog  up. 

Another   authority  advises   as    follows: 

"The  dog  will,  however,  require  great  care  exercised  in  keeping  him 
warm  and  in  a  well-ventilated  place,  as  well  as  in  being,  supported  with 
easily-digested  food,  such  as  strong  broth,  beef  tea,,  boiled  milk,  bread, 
etc.  In  the  early  stages  compound  spirit  of  sulphuric  ether,  given  in  milk 
+  hree  times  a  day,  is  generally  beneficial.  Dose  for  a  twenty  pound  dog,  15 
drops;  Any  discharge  from  the  nose  should  be  encouraged  by  warm  fomen- 
tations and  making  the  dog  inhale  the  vapor  from  vinegar  or  squills  sprink- 
led on  a  hot,  wet  sponge  or  cloth.  If  the  throat  is  swollen  and  sore,  slightly 
blister  with  vinegar  and  mustard.  In  convalescence  give  cod  liver  oil  and 
syrup  of  iodide  of  iron,"  or  Eberhart's  Tonic  Pills  instead  of  the  cod  liver 
oil  and  iron,  are  just  the  thing  to  use  here. 

The  following  is  also  good  advice  on  Influenza: 

Symptoms:  The  disease  is  commonly  located  in  the  mucous  mem- 
brane of  the  nose,  the  lungs  and  air  passages.  The  first  symptoms  are 
those  of  a  common  cold  chill,  lassitude,  shivering,  sneezing  and  loss  of 
appetite.  The  small  veins  of  the  eye  and  membranes  are  injected  and 
there  is  a  profuse  discharge  "of  tears,  as  well  as  a  swelling  of  the  nasal 
membranes.  The  throat  becomes  sore  and  there  is  a  dry,  hoarse  cough 
that  is  sometimes  so  severe  as  to  terminate  in  attempts  to  vomit.  Breath- 
ing is  hurried  and  painful  and  prostration  is  well  marked.  The  patient  is 
dull  and  sleepy,  and,  when  forced  to  move  acts  stiff,  sore  and  lame.  There 
is  more  or  less  fever  of  an  intermittent  type  and  the  animal  suffers  from 
excessive  thirst.  The  pulse  is  irregular  and  usually  is  full  and  soft.  Diges- 
tion is  disturbed  and  the  bowels  are  generally  too  loose,  although  in  some 
cases  constipated.      Expectoration   is  scanty,   but   frequently  attempted. 

Treatment:  Keep  the  patient  warm  and  in  a  room  that  is  well  venti- 
lated and  free  from  draughts.  Allow  plenty  of  cold  water  to  drink  and  feed 
anything  the  patient  will  eat.  Broths  of  mutton,  beef  or  milk  are  good, 
as  well  as  raw,  loan  beef,  chopped  fine;  egg  noggs.  raw  eggs,  gelatine,  etc, 
If  the  temperature  is  high  and  continues  so.  give  quinine  in  two-grain 
doses  every  four  hours  until  it  is  reduced.  If  the  bowels  are  constipated, 
loosen  them  by  doses  of  olive  oil,  a  tablespoonful  to  a  dose.  If  the  throat 
is  badly  congested  and  breathing  is  difficult,  it  should  be  rubbed  with 
some  camphorated  oil,  or  hot  applications  applied,  and  then  bandaged  with 
soft  flannel. 

The  following  prescription  is  highly  recommended:  Ammonia  mur. 
and  ext.  of  glycyrrhizae  pulv.,  of  each  two  drams;   aquae,  three  ounces. 

Give  one  teaspoonful  in  water,  every  three  hours. 

It  is  important  that  the  animal's  strength  be  kept  up  and  cod  liver 
oil  should  be  given  in  tablespoonful  doses  four  times  a  day,  as  well  as  the 
syrup  of  iodide  of  iron. 

The  doses  given  are  for  medium  sized  dogs,  use  judgment  if  for 
small  dogs. 


IrLs,   Inflammation  or. — See  Iritis. 

Injury  to  the  Brain — The  bony  covering  of  the  brain  is  very  strong  in 
the  dog.  They  are  liable  to  accidents  from  falls  on  the  head,  running  full 
force  against  some  obstacle,  or  from  a  blow,  which  may  cause  concussion 
of  the  brain.  The  dog  will  lie  stunned  or  insensible,  breathing  feebly,  and 
pulse  small  and  quick.  In  treating,  examine  the  head  for  fracture  of  the 
skull,  and,  if  bleeding,  stop  it  by  cold  applications.  In  cases  of  this  kind 
consult  a  good  veterinary  surgeon.  Until  he  comes  rub  brandy  or  whisky 
on  the  gums  and  keep  the  body  warm.  If  you  have  on  hand  ammonia  hold 
it  to  the  nostrils. 

Intussusception. — See  Bowels,  Obstruction  of. — This  is  a  slipping  of 
one  portion  of  the  intestines  that  has  been  contracted  by  spasm,  within 
another  part  retaining  its  natural  diameter,  and  is  another  and  not  uncom- 
mon cause  of  obstruction,  and  apt  to  occur  during  spasmodic  colic.  It  is 
fatal,  and  can  not  be  determined  by  symptoms,  a  postmortem  only  showing 
the  trouble.  No  dog  should  be  allowed  to  be  costive  over  two  days,  and 
not  so  long,  is  much  safer,  without  having  been  helped  by  proper  remedies 
prescribed  elsewhere.  It  is  always  safe,  however,  and  advisable  to  give  in 
such  cases  a  full  dose  of  castor  oil,  olive  oil  or  a  mixture  of  both.  Worms 
can  cause  obstruction  in  the  intestines,  especially  in  puppies,  round  worms 
getting  coiled  up  into  balls,  which  sets  up  local  irritation,  interfering  with 
the  natural   action   of  the  bowels. 

Jaundice,  or  the  "Yellows,"  and  Inflammation  of  (he  Liver  (Hepatitis). 
— These  should  be  treated  as  distinct  diseases,  but  to  the  ordinary  dog 
owner  the  division  would  be  of  little  use.  the  causes  and  general  treatment 
being  alike.  There  are  two  forms  of  inflammation  of  the  liver — the  acute 
and  chronic,  the  former  the  rarer,  which  appears  more  suddenly;  the  latter 
comes  as  a  sequel  of  the  acute.  The  causes  of  this  disease,  in  most  cases, 
are  traceable  to  improper  and  over-feeding,  combined  with  lack  of  exercise, 
which  accounts  for  the  great  number  of  such  cases  occurring  in  house  and 
pet  dogs.  In  hunting  dogs  it  can  be  brought  on  by  continued  exposure  to 
wet,  or  their  going  into  water  in  cold  weather,  sleeping  in  damp  places, 
of  over-exertion. 

One  very  common  cause  is  the  repeated  resort  to  powerful  emetics, 
which  so  many  use  as  if  they  possessed  a  charm  over  dog  diseases. 

Symptoms. — Dog  is  dull,  restless  in  his  sleep,  has  excessive  thirst,  very 
poor  appetite,  becomes  thin,  and  the  portions  of  his  skin  not  covered  by 
hair  you  will  readily  notice  to  be  of  a  yellowish  color  or  tinge.  This  will 
be  seen  on  the  gums,  lips,  and  under  the  legs.  The  discharge  is  fetid,  and 
urine,  passed  in  small  quantities,  is  yellow.  There  is  also  fever,  with  fits 
of  heat  and  shivering.  Vomiting  sometimes  occurs;  the  matter  ejected 
is  slimy  and  of  a  yellowish  color;  the  bowels  are  generally  constipated, 
and  the  excrement  of  a  pale  clay  color.  In  chronic  cases  the  belly  is  often 
enlarged  and  flatulence  often  exists.  In  severe  cases  the  dog  will  los« 
flesh  rapidly,  and  soon  become  a  mere  skeleton.  The  liver,  in  a  healthy 
state,  secretes  a  yellow  fluid  called  the  gall,  which  is  collected  in  the  gall 


bladder,  intended  to  mix  with  the  chyle,  completing  digestion.  When  ob- 
struction of  the  gall  bladder  takes  place  the  gall  is  diverted  from  its 
natural  purpose,  is  reabsorbed  by  the  blood  vessels,  enters  the  general 
system,  giving  a  bright  saffron  color  to  the  eyes,  lips,  inside  of  the  ears, 
arms  and  thighs,  sometimes  to  the  whole  skin,  and  from  this  it  is  often 
called  the  "Yellows." 

Jaundice  is  of  frequent  occurrence,  often  exists  as  a  sequel  to  distem- 
per, and  when  this  is  the  case  is  most  difficult  to  manage  on  account  of 
the  already  reduced  strength  of  the  patient.  Treatment  must  to  some 
extent  be  governed  by  circumstances  of  each  case. 

The  invariable  yellow  color  of  the  parts  mentioned  as  a  symptom  in 
this  disease  is  one  which  the  least  careful  observer  cannot  fail  to  notice; 
but  before  this  occurs  there  are  other  symptoms  which  should  not  be 
overlooked.  In  the  earlier  stages  the  dog's  appetite  fails;  he  suffers  con- 
siderable thirst  which  increases  as  the  disease  progreses;  there  is  fever, 
with  alternate  fits  of  heat  and  shivering;  vomiting  may  occur,  and  the 
matter  ejected  is  generally  slimy  and  of  a  yellowish  color;  the  urine  is 
passed  in  small  quantities,  and  is  a  deep  yellow  color;  the  bowels  are 
generally  constipated,  and  the  excrement  is  of  a  pale  clay  color.  In  chronic 
cases  the  belly  is  enlarged,  and  flatulence  often  exists;  while  on  the  right 
side  a  swelling  may  be  felt.  In  severe  cases  the  dog  rapidly  loss  flesh 
and  soon  becomes  a  mere  skeleton;  the  coat  is  rough  and  staring,  and 
often  somes  off  in  patches.  All  writers  I  have  consulted  on  the  subject 
recommend  mercury  in  the  treatment  of  jaundice,  so  I  here  give  par- 
ticulars of  its  dose,  and  the  mode  of  administering  it,  for  the  benefit  of 
my  readers,  although  I  do  not  myself  use  it. 

Mercurial  Treatment  of  Jaundice. — Calomel  2  grains  to  4  grains,  with 
1  grain  of  opium  every  six  hours,  as  per  size  of  dog,  is  not  uncommon  pre- 
scription. Or  another  treatment  is:  Blue  pill  3  grains,  opium  1  grain, 
to  be  given  every  five  or  six  hours.  If  diarrhea  be  produced  by  this  treat- 
ment, the  quantity  of  opium  must  be  increased,  and  the  mercury,  if  neces- 
sary, reduced  to  2  grains. 

I   prefer   to   use  the   Compound   Podophyllin   Pills: 

Podophyllin     6  grains 

Compound  extract  of  colocynth 30  grains 

Powdered    rhubarb     48  grains 

Extract  of  henbane    36  grains 

Mix  and  divide  into  twenty-four  pills.     One  pill  to  dog  up  to  20  lbs., 
two   pills   to   larger  ones. 

If  the  bowels  be  not  freely  opened  after  administering  the  first  pill  a 
close  of  salts  and  senna  (black  draught)  should  be  given;  on  the  other 
hand,  if  diarrhea  exists  it  must  be  checked.  In  conjunction  with  the  pills 
the  following  mixture  should  be  tried: 

Mixture  for  Jaundice. — Take  bromide  of  potassium,  1  dram;  taraza- 
cum  (dandelion)  juice,  3  ounces;  mix,  and  give  a  teaspoonful  three  times 
a  day  in  water  or  gruel.     This  dose  is  for  a  dog  about  20   lb.  weight,  for 


 

a  50  lb.  or  larger  dog  give  a  two  teaspoonful  dose.  Benefit  is  also  derived 
from  the  administration  of  30  grains  to  60  grains  of  sulphate  of  potassium 
in  water.  The  dose  may  be  repeated  in  twenty-four  hours,  but  must  not 
be  continued  long  enough  to  cause  excessive  purging. 

When,  as  in  chronic  inflammation,  the  liver  is  enlarged,  the  Liniment 
for  Sprains,  equal  parts  of  spirits  of  turpentine,  liquid  ammonia  (not  the 
strongest),  laudanum  and  rape  oil,  well  rubbed  round  the  region  of  the 
diseased  organ,  or  a  strong  mustard  plaster  applied.  Another  method  of 
affording  relief  is  to  take  a  piece  of  flannel,  dip  it  in  hot  water,  wring  the 
water  out,  pour  some  spirit  of  turpentine  over  the  material,  and  apply  to 
the  affected  part.  It  is  very  important  that  the  bowels  should  be  freely 
relieved  at  the  outset,  and  if  the  means  advised  above  prove  unsuccessful, 
it  would  be  well  to  resort  to  clysters  of  oatmeal  gruel  and  castor  oil.  The 
diet  is  very  important  throughout  the  attack.  Must  be  light  and  nourishing, 
and  in  a  fluid  or  sloppy  form.  Boiled  wheat  flour,  with  beef  tea  or  mutton 
broth,  is  very  good.     Keep  dog  warm,  dry,  and  disturbed  as  little  as  possible. 

Kennel  Lameness,  or  Chest-Founder. —  (See  Rheumatism,  also.) — This 
is  a  rheumatic  affection  of  the  forequarters,  and  particularly  of  the  muscles 
connecting  the  shoulder-blade  with  the  trunk.  It  is  caused  by  exposure  to 
wet  and  cold,  and  generally  by  the  dog  being  kept  in  damp  or  draughty 
kennels.  The  symptoms  are  stiffness  and  soreness  of  one  or  both  shoul- 
ders. This  is  most  noticeable  when  the.  dog  is  running  down  hill,  or  when 
jumping,  as  of  course  then  practically  the  whole  of  the  weight  of  the  body 
is  on  these  parts.  Left  to  himself,  the  dog  shows  an  indisposition  to  move, 
and  experiences  pain  if  the  hand  is  passed  over  his  shoulders;  indeed,  even 
when  a  attempt  is  made  to  touch  him,  he  shrinks  from  the  hand  with  a 
snarl  or  anticipatory  cry  of  pain.  In  long-standing  cases  power  of  move- 
ment of  the  forequarters  is  almost  lost,  and  many  are  incurable. 

The  treatment  most  advised  is  to  give  a  warm  bath,  and  after  thor- 
oughly drying,  rub  the  parts  well  with  a  liniment  composed  of  equal  parts 
spirit  of  turpentine,  spirit  of  hartshorn,  and  laudanum.  If  that  should 
fail  to  give  relief  the  following  should  be  tried: 

Liniment  for  Rheumatism.— Take  liniment  of  aconite,  1  part;  com- 
pound camphor  liniment,  2  parts;  mix,  and  rub  into  the  affected  parts  con- 
tinuously for  half  an  hour  at  a  time,  using  considerable  friction.  The 
rheumatic  liniment  is  expensive,  also  a  powerful  poison,  so  that  great  care 
must  be  used  with  it. 

The  dog's  coat  should  be  wiped  dry  after  applying  it,  and  it  is  advisable 
that  he  should  wear  a  canvas-faced  muzzle.  The  bowels  should  be  freely 
acted  on,  and  the  Compound  Podophyllin  Pills  (find  prescription  under 
Asthma)  will  be  the  best  aperient.  This  pill  given  once  will  probably  be 
enough.  A  little  warm  broth  after  given  will  assist  its  action.  The  fol- 
lowing mixture  should  also  be  given: 

Mixture  for  Rheumatism. — Take  iodide  of  potassium,  y2  dram;  sweet 
spirit  of  nitre,  Y2  ounce;  water,  3%  ounces.  Give  one  to  two  dessert- 
spoonfuls for  a  dose,  twice  a  day. 

Even  more  useful  than  the  mixture  recommended,  is  salicylate  of 
sodium   in    10   grain   to   30   grain   doses,   in   water,   three   times   a   day.      If 
this  fail,  then  try   5  grains  to  15  grains  of  benzoic  acid  in  pill  form,  twice 

a-day. 

The  food  shoufd  be  sloppy  and  nourishing,  and  the  dog  be  kept  in  a 
warm,  dry  place,  free  from  draught. 

Kidneys,    Inflammation   of   the This    is    fortunately    not    often    found 

in  the  dog.  It  is  a  disease  of  a  very  dangerous  nature.  The  symptoms  are 
intense  fever,  great  pains  across  the  loins,  a  peculiar  straddling  gait  and  the 
ineffectual  or  partial  effort  to  pass  urine,  the  quantity  being  small  and 
sometimes  mixed  with  blood.  It  may  be  caused  by  the  presence  of  stone, 
by  blows  or  sprains  in  the  lumbar  region,  or  due  as  a  result  of  having 
administered  overdoses  of  turpentine,  cantharides,  or  other  powerful  exci- 
tants of  the  urinary  organs.  It  is  safest  and  advisable  to  call  in  a  qualified 
veterinarian  in  this  trouble.  Relief  can  be  given  by  continuous  bathing  of 
the  surrounding  parts  with  warm  water,  relieving  the  bowels,  and  re- 
ducing the  attendant  fever  by  daily  doses  of  (12  grains  for  an  ordinary  dog) 
of  Dover's  Powder,  and  the  constant  use  of  the  following  fever  mixture: 

Powdered    nitre    1        dram 

Sweet  spirits  of  nitre    y2    ounce 

Mindererous    spirit    ' 1  yz  ounce 

Wine  or  antimony    1        dram 

Water     4        ounces 

Mix;  dose  for  a  20  lb.  to  40  lb.  dog,  one  tablespoonful  every  four 
hours  in  a  little  gruel.  Larger  dogs  like  St.  Bernards  a  table- 
spoonful  and  a  half  as  a  dose. 

Keeping  Flies  Off  Ear  and  Nose. — Flies  often  bother  a  dog's  ear  and 
nose  in  summer,  making  sore  places.  Pine  tar  rubbed  on  the  sore  places 
will  do  this  nicely,  also  healing  up  the  sores  at  same  time.  You  can  get 
a  box  of  it  at  any  drug  store  for  10  cents,  or  Eberhart's  Skin  Cure  applied 
twice  daily  will  do  the  work  as  well. 

Lice. — See  Parasites  External. 

Lice. — There  are  two  kinds  of  lice  which  infest  dogs,  and  both  of 
them  are  quite  similar  to  those  infesting  man.  One,  the  Haematopinus 
piliferus,  is  generally  found  about  the  throat  and  back  of  the  ears,  but  may 
extend  over  all  parts  of  the  body.  The  female  is  two  mm.  long,  in  color 
a  yellowish  white,  the  head  being  a  little  darker  than  the  body.  The  male 
is  1.15  mm.  long.  The  head  is  short  and  as  wide  as  it  is  long.  It  is  salient 
and  is  exactly  applied  to  the  thorax.  The  third  and  fourth  articles  of  the 
antennae  are  alike.  The  female  is  about  2  mm.  in  length.  The  abdomen 
is  a  long  oval  in  shape  and  well  developed.  It  is  made  up  of  nine  round 
segments,  the  first  seven  having  two  rows  of  short  bristles.  The  other 
louse  (Trichodectes  latus)  is  a  bright  yellow,  with  dark  spots,  with  blackish 
brown  bands  on  the  head.  The  female  in  length  is  1.5  mm.,  the  male  1.4 
mm.     The  head  is  wider  than  it  is  long.     The  antennae  are  hairy  and  differ- 


 

ent  In  both  sexes,  the  first  article  in  the  male  being  much  thicker  than 
the  other.  The  abdomen  is  broad  and  more  rounded  in  the  female  than  in 
the  male  and  has  lateral  but  no  median  spots. 

Lice  live  in  all  parts  of  the  body — the  roots  of  the  ears,  around  the  eyes 
and  all  about  the  head  and  face,  as  well  as  along  the  top  of  the  back.  They 
spt  up  an  irritation  that  causes  the  dog  to  scratch  and  worry  continually, 
and  if  the  skin  be  closely  examined  streaks  and  dots  of  blood  will  indicate 
the  feeding  places  of  these  pests,  which  are  easily  discerned  creeping  about. 

The  rapidity  with  which  lice  multiply  is  marvelous.  Independent  of 
the  destructive  influences  which  restrain  their  multiplying,  it  is  estimated 
that  the  descendants  in  the  third  generation  of  one  female  louse  will  num- 
ber 125,000.  v 

The  most  effectual  and  the  safest  remedy  for  the  destruction  of  lice 
is  a  lime  and  sulphur  lotion.  The  skin  should  be  thoroughly  saturated 
with  it  for  ten  or  fifteen  minutes,  and  at  the  end  of  this  time  the  dog 
should  be  given  a  bath  in  lukewarm  water,  a  standard  dog  soap  being 
used.  He  should  then  be  brushed  and  combed  until  thoroughly  dried. 
Covering  the  dog  with  a  mixture  of  cotton  seed  oil  and  crude  coal  oil  in 
equal  parts  and  then  washing  the  dog  at  the  end  of  a  half  hour  with  warm 
water  and  dog  soap  will  kill  eithpr  fleas  or  lice. 

Eberhart's  Skin  Remedy  will  kill  lice.  It  should  be  thoroughly  rub- 
bed in,  not  missing  a  spot  on  the  dog.  After  it  has  been  on  half  an  hour, 
then  the  dog  can  be  washed  and  dried;  this  bath  only  given  to  remove  the 
grease,  if  it  is  a  house  pet.  .  If  in  warm  weather,  and  dog  can  be  kept  out 
in  the  yard,  the  bath  is  not  necessary.  The  application  must  be  repeated 
at  least  once  more,  In  twenty-four  hours,  to  kill  the  nits  or  the  young 
ones  that  are  born  every  twenty-four  hours.  My  dog  soap  will  kill  lice, 
if  you  apply  it  thoroughly,  and  allow  it  to  remain  on  (and  repeat  once  or 
twice  more. 

For  pet  or  house  dogs  the  insect  powders  generally  made  from  the 
powdered  flowers  of  pyrethrum  roseum  will  be  found  most  convenient. 
Unfortunately  their  expense  precludes  their  general  use  in  kennels.  The 
powder  must  be  well  rubbed  into  the  roots  of  the  hair  or  blown  in  with  a 
small  bellows,  made  for  that  purpose,  that  is  of  assistance  in  spreading  it 
well  around  the  roots  of  the  hair.  After  allowing  it  to  remain  on  some 
time — fifteen  minutes  to  one  hour — it  can  be  dusted  out  over  a  sheet  of  pa- 
per, which  can  then  be  rolled  up  and  burned. 

Lock-Jaw  (Tetanus) — This  is  of  very  rare  occurrence,  a  fact  all  the 
more  remarkable  when  we  consider  how  liable  the  dog  is  to  various  spas- 
modic affections.  I  have  never  seen  a  case  of  it  myself,  but  Blaine  describes 
it,  and  it  is  a  recognized  canine  disease.  It  is  a  form  of  tetanus,  and  under 
that  head  Professor  J.  Woodroffe  Hill  describes  the  symptoms:  "When  the 
jaws  only  are  affected,  the  head  is  poked  out,  the  jaws  are  tightly  closed, 
the  angles  of  the  mouth  are  drawn  back,  the  mouth  is  filled  with  frothy 
saliva,  and  the  eyes  are  fixed  in  an  unnatural  and  often  hideous  position." 

If  you  are  so  unfortunate  as  to  have  a  dog  seized  with  lock-jaw,  place 
him  in  quiet  place  on  a  good  bed  where  the  light  is  subdued  and  he  will 
not  be  liable   to  be   disturbed,   and   send   at  once   for   the  best  veterinary 




surgeon  you  can  find.  A  cure  is  very  doubtful,  even  with  the  most  skilled 
treatment;  but,  as  a  matter  of  duty  and  humanity,  try  and  help  your  dog 
through  this  most  dangerous  trouble  if  it  is  possible.  All  owners  of  dogs 
should  keep  informed  as  to  the  veterinarians  in  their  town  or  city,  as  to 
which  one  is  experienced  in  canine  practice,  so  that  when  a  case  is  urgent, 
you  will  know  what  one  to  call  in  and  just  where  to  find  him.  Officious 
ignorance  and  rough  handling  would  only  cause  pain  without  the  remotest 
hope  of  good  results. 

Looseness  of  the  Bowels — See  Diarrhea  and  Dysentery. 

Lumbago. — See  Rheumatism. 

Leucorrhoea. — Use  as  an  injection  peroagina  sulphate  of  zinc,  %  dram;

in  bad  cases  it  can  be  used  twice  daily. 

Lacteal  Tumors. — No  better  treatise  on  this  trouble  can  be  given  than 
Dalziel's: 

"Every  dog  owner  must  know  what  a  common  <:hing  it  is  to  see  a  bitch 
with  an  enlargement  of  one  of  her  teats,  or  the  structures  adjoining  them. 
Now,  not  only  is  such  very  unsightly,  but  when  grown  to  a  considerable 
Size,  as  it  will  do,  it  is  very  liable  to  injury. 

"The  immediate  cause  is  the  damming  up  of  one  of  the  milk-ducts; 
the  teat  is  'blind,'  as  it  is  called  in  dairy  parlance — that  is,  the  flow  of 
milk  through  it  is  obstructed  by  some  malformation.  Far  oftener,  however, 
the  milk  itself  is  the  cause;  that  is  to  say,  it  is  not  drained  off  sufficiently, 
when  it  hardens,  acts  as  a  foreign  body,  and  still  further  as  an  irritant,  be- 
cause of  its  chemical  decomposition.  The  effect  of  this  is  that  more  or  less 
inflammation  of  the  milk-gland  is  produced,  a  hard  lump  forms  and  increases 
gradually,  and  once  begun,  the  evil  develops  more  and  more  at  each  return- 
ing period  after  oestrum,  when  pupping  has  or  should  have  taken  place. 

"From  the  numerous  questions  I  have  received  on  the  subject  it  does 
not  appear  to  be  generally  known  by  those  who  keep  dogs  that  some  bitches, 
even  if  they  have  been  secluded  from  the  dog  during  the  period  of  'heat,' 
will  secrete  a  fluid  much  resembling  milk  at  the  time  they  would  have  had 
pups  had  impregnation  been  allowed,  but  such  is  the  case.  It  is,  therefore, 
the  duty  of  the  owner  to  note  the  time  and  look  out  for  the  evidence  of 
this  secretion  and  have  it  removed  by  hand,  or  by  one  of  the  many  breast- 
exhausters,  giving  at  the  same  time  a  light  diet,  with  an  extra  proportion  of 
boiled  vegetables  and  a  few  doses  of  cooling,  aperient  medicine.  Permit- 
ting a  bitch  when  in  milk  to  lie  on  cold  bricks  or  flags,  or  to  be  exposed  in 
other  ways  to  cold  and  damp,  may  also  cause  obstruction  af  the  teat  and 
subsequent  tumors;  while  blows,  bruises  and  wounds  sometimes  produce  a 
like  result.  A  not  uncommon  cause  of  these  lacteal  tumors  Is  the  hurried 
drying  up  of  the  milk  by  artificial  means.  It  is  sometimes  desirable  to 
destroy  pups  that  are  the  result  of  a  mesalliance,  but  it  is  absolutely  cruel 
to  deprive  the  poor  mother  of  all  her  progeny.     In  addition  to  the  cruelty, 


 

there  is  always  the  risk  of  the  flow  of  milk  clamming  up  one  or  more  of  the 
teats  and  producing  tumor. 

"The  measure  of  prevention  against  lacteal  tumors  will,  from  the 
foregoing  remarks,  have  suggested  themselves  to  the  reader.  Nature  has 
ordained  that  the  bitch  should  bring  forth  young  at  least  once  in  twelve 
months,  and,  though  she  permits  us  to  take  certa'n  liberties  with  her  laws, 
yet  if  we  go  beyond  a  certain  limit,  disease  follows  as  a  punishment;  even 
when  we  interfere  with  her  prerogative,  it  must  not  be  by  direct  contradic- 
tion, but  by  diverting  her  forces  into  other  channels.  When  we  forbid  the 
bitch  to  breed  we  put  an  embargo  on  certain  functions,  and  the  energy 
that  supplies  and  works  these  functions  we  divert  by  exciting  extra  secre- 
tions of  the  bowels,  kidneys,  etc.;  but  the  safest,  because  the  most  natural, 
prevention  of  disease,  is  to  let  the  bitch  breed. 

"When  it  is  desired  to  'dry'  the  bitch,  that  is,  to  stop  the  secretion  of 
milk,  it  is  wrong  to  give  alum  and  other  astringents,  and  to  rub  brandy, 
etc.,  along  the  mammae.  The  object  is  more  surely  obtained  gradually, 
and  that  without  the  risk  of  untoward  results,  by  drawing  off  what  m,-lk 
there  is  regularly,  giving  a  spare  diet,  and  a  good  purge,  following  this 
with  2  grains  to  3  grains  of  iodide  of  potassium,  twice  a  day,  and  rubbing 
well  with  the  following  liniment: 

L'niment  for  Drying  Bitches. — Iod'de  of  potassium,  2  drams;  soap  lini- 
ment and  oil  of  camphor,  of  each  2  ounces. 

When  a  tumor  does  form,  and  the  bitch  is  still  in  milk,  draw  the  milk 
off  twice  a  day,  and  in  any  case,  give  a  brisk  purge.  Keep  her  on  a  spare, 
and  rather  dry  diet,  and  to  one  of  20  lb.  weight  give  twice  a  day  2  grains 
of  iodide  of  potassium,  in  about  two  tablespoonfuls  of  water,  immediately 
after  feeding,  and  apply  twice  Or  thrice  a  day  the  following  ointment  to 
the  lumps  or  swelling  i 

pi'ifmeut  for  Lacteal  Tumors: 

Iodide  of  potassium   ,,,,,,,,,,,      1  Arnux 

powdered   camphor    ,.,,,,,.,...      1  dram 

Strong  mercurial  ointment   ,,,,,,,.,...........    V2  ounce 

Spermaceti  ointment    .,,,...... .  1  oinwn 

Mixed,     Rub  a  little  W©il  in  with  gentle  friGUct). 

If  these  means  do  not  prove  sufficient  for  the  dispersion  of  the  swell- 
ing, add  to  the  above  ointment  2  scr,  of  resublimcd  iodine  dissolved  in,  a, 
little  spirit  of  wine. 

When  the  swelling  has  gone  on  so  far  unheeded  that  matter  is  formed, 
and  becomes  soft  and  ripe  (which  may  be  told  by  the  fluctuating  of  the 
enlargement  under  pressure  of  the  finders  \  there  is  nothing  for  it  but  the 
lancet,  which  should  be  inserted  in  the  soft  1  a.  t,  and  a  cut  made  downwards, 
to  insure  perfect  drainage.  The  parts  must  then  be  frequently  bathed,  the 
matter  pressed  out,  washed  with  a  solution  of  Condy's  FluM,  and  dressed 
with  Turner's  cerate,  while  the  pat;ent  should  havo  a  g^orl  ctrcn~  purg*. 
These  growths  are  often,  removed  by  the  knife,  and  when  of.  long  standing 




that  is  the  only  course.     Camphorated  Oil  is  also  used  in  such  cases,  and 
for  drying  up  the  milk  I  have  found  it  very  satisfactory. 

Dent  treats  this  subject  as  follows: 

"Nature  has  ordained  that  at  least  once  a  year  certain  nervous  energies 
in  the  female  clog  be  set  in  motion.  This  nervous  force  excites  the  bowels, 
the  brain,  the  kidneys,  the  circulation,  and  all  the  other  organs  "of  the  body, 
and  what  is  known  as  the  period  of  oestrum,  or  being  in  season,  is  the 
result.  If  the  bitch  be  bred  at  this  time  a  natural  function  is  performed 
and  a  natural  law  satisfied.  If  she  is  not  bred  these  functions  are  seriously 
interfered  with  for  the  time,  how  seriously  or  the  extent  of  the  interference 
we  do  not  know.  That  this  nervous  action  does  not  cease  or  is  entirely 
suppressed  by  simply  putting  the  bitch  by  for  the  time  is  unmistakably 
denied  by  subsequent  events.  A  natural  prerogative  asserts  itself  and  it  is 
a  common  occurrence  for  bitches  which  have  not  been  bred  to  develop 
a  feverish  disturbance  of  the  system,  a  swelling  of  the  milk  glands  and  the 
secretion  of  a  whitish  fluid  resembling  milk  at  the  time  they  would  have 
given  birth  to  puppies  if  they  had  been  bred. 

"If  this  milky  fluid  is  not  drawn  off  with  the  breast  pump  there  is 
danger  of  its  hardening  and  forming  a  lacteal  tumor.  In  passing  a  bitch 
over  the  period  of  oestrum  without  breeding  her,  it  would  be  well  for  all 
breeders  to  anticipate  the  possibility  of  this  secretion;  watch  for  it  at 
the  proper  time.  Remove  it  if  it  appears  and  feed  for  the  time  a  light, 
cooling  diet  of  stale  bread  or  dog  biscuits  softened  in  soup  or  milk,  with  an 
increased  amount  of  vegetables,  and  keep  the  bowels  open  with  doses  of 
cascara  sagrada  and  olive  oil  as  often  as  may  be  necessary.  In  cases  of 
a  misalliance  the  puppies  are  frequently  destroyed  at  birth.  This  is  posi- 
tively cruel  to  the  mother  and  the  shock  to  her  nervous  system  is  so  great  as 
to  frequently  affect  her  constitution.  The  puppies  should  be  taken  away  as 
previously  stated,  one  or  two  at  a  time,  and  the  milk  dried  up,  with  the 
same  care  as  if  the  puppies  were  to  be  raised. 

"Lacteal  tumors  sometimes  result  from  blows,  wounds,  kicks  and  other 
injuries;  exposure  to  the  cold,  sudden  chills  from  lying  on  damp  straw  or 
upon  cold  bricks  or  cement  floors.  The  great  proportion  of  cases,  however,  is 
due  to  the  causes,  first  mentioned. 

"Treatment. — To  dry  a  bitch  up  properly  and  prevent  the  formation  of 
milk  tumors  after  removing  the  puppies  as  previously  described,  keep  the 
bowels  open  with  cascara  sagrada  and  olive  oil;  feed  a  spare  diet  or  raw, 
lean  beef,  chopped  fine,  milk,  gelatin,  eggs,  stale  bread  or  dog  biscuits  soaked 
in  thin  soup.  If  there  is  any  milk  remaining  in  the  gland  draw  it  off 
night  and  morning  with  a  breast  pump. 

"Apply  the  following  liniment  three  times  a  day,  with  gentle  massage: 
Camphorated  oil  four  ounces,  fluid  extract  of  belladonna  three  drams,  soap 
liniment  two  ounces,  witch  hazel  two  ounces. 

"Give  a  thirty-pound  dog  a  capsule  containing  of  the  iodide  of  potash 
three  grains,  pepsin   three  grains,  gentian  three  grains,  diastase  one  grain. 

"For  the  removal  of  lacteal  tumors  the  following  ointment  is  recom- 
mended: Iodide  of  potassium  two  drams,  powdered  camphor  two  grains, 
mercurial  ointment  two  drams,   iodine  resub  ten  grains,  five  grains  of  men- 


r  

thol  alcohol  q.  s.,  lanolin  three  ounces.  Apply  three  times  a  clay  and  rub  well 
into  the  skin  with  gentle  friction.  The  capsules  previously  mentioned 
should  also  be  given  three  times  a  day. 

"Tumors  that  do  not  yield  to  the  treatment,  or  have  been  let  go  so 
far  as  to  become  ripe  or  full  of  matter,  can  only  be  treated  with  the 
knife.  Operations  should  only  be  entrusted  to  a  veterinary  surgeon,  who 
will  insert  the  lancet  at  the  softest  spot  of  the  enlargement  and  drain  off 
the  contents,  afterward  inserting  a  pledget  of  oakum  which  should  be 
changed  daily.  Large  tumors  that  do  not  soften  should  be  dissected  out 
entire  and  the  wound  properly  dressed." 

Labor,  Premature. — This  is  occasionally  caused  by  over  exertion,  leap- 
ing from  a  high  place,  injuries  and  the  abuse  of  purgatives,  as  well  as  the. 
result  of  diseased  organs;  it  is  not  of  very  frequent  occurrence,  bitches 
generally  whelping  exactly  sixty-three  days  after  the  visit  to  the  dog,  al- 
though there  are  numerous  instances  where  the  time  is  varied  more  or 
less.  When  it  does  occur  the  bitch  should  be  placed  in  a  comfortable 
room  and  kept  perfectly  quiet,  fed  on  broth,  porridge,  &c,  and  repeated 
doses,  one  every  four  or  five  hours,  of  opium,  should  be  given.  See  also 
Parturition. 

Lameness  may  arise  from  a  cut  foot,  a  thorn,  injury  to  the  spine,  or 

to  one  of  the  limbs  or  joints  or  from  rheumatism,  when  it  comes  on 
suddenly,  seek  for  the  cause,  and  treat  the  case  accordingly,  the  liniment 
for  sprains  very  likely  to  be  of  benefit  in  many  of  such  cases. 

Laryngitis,  or  Inflammation  of  the  Upper  Part  of  the  "Windpipe. — This 
common  affection  is  caused  by  cold  or  incessant  barking,  the  dog  becomes 
hoarse  and  the  power  to  bark  articulately  is  gone.  Yard  dogs  kept  con- 
stantly on  chain,  and  very  wrong  to  so  keep  any  dog,  are  very  liable  to 
contract  this  from  straining  on  their  collar  in  barking  and  trying  to  get  at 
somebody  or  something  it  sees.  In  treating  laryngitis  there  is  danger  of 
choking  the  dog  in  drenching  because  of  the  difficulty  in  swallowing  caused 
by  the  inflammation.  The  following  electuary  in  this  or  any  case  of  sore 
throat  will  be  found  safer  and  very  beneficial: 

Chlorate  of  potash,  finely  powdered 2   drams 

Powdered   gum    guaicum    1   dram 

Powdered   gum   acacia    ' 1   dram 

Oxymel   of   squills    5   drams 

Honey    1   ounce 

Mix,  and  place  a  teaspoonful  well  back  on  the  tongue  three  times  a 
day. 

Poultice  the  throat  with  hot  linseed  meal  poultices,  renewed  often,  or 
bathe  with  hot  water,  and  afterwards  rubbed  well  in  the  following  liniment: 

Spirit  of  turpentine .  .  ,  , 1   ounce 

Spirit   of  hartshorn     ..  .,,,,,,,,,,,,,.,,,  ,    X   ounce 

Tincture   of  cantharldes    %   ounce 

Rape  oil   , ,,,,,,  1  ft  ounoes 



Here  is  a  case  prescribed  for  by  Dent: 

"I  have  an  English  setter  dog  about  twenty  months  old  that  acts  as 
though  he  had  something  in  his  throat.  It  affects  his  breathing,  and  when 
he  first  showed  symptoms  of  it  his  eyes  were  red  and  ran  matter.  He 
eats  sometimes,  but  at  others  will  not  eat;  is  healthy  and  bright.  I  can  put 
my  finger  under  his  throat  and  press  very  lightly,  and  it  almost  shuts  off 
his  wind.  It  seems  as  though  there  was  a  kind  of  bunch  in  his  throat 
that  is  not  natural.  (1)  Would  inflammation  of  the  larynx  cause  it? 
(2)  Is  there  such  a  thing  as  a  tumor  of  the  larynx?  I  had  him  in  swim- 
ming about  four  weeks  ago,  and  when  he  was  in  the  water  his  breathing 
sounded  like  the  voice  of  a  frog.  Please  diagnose  and  prescribe.  Ans.— 
(1)  Yes.  (2)  Yes.  Your  dog  has  laryngitis;  give  the  following:  Glycrrhiza 
two  drams,  muriate  of  ammonia  one  dram,  tincture  opium  thirty  minims, 
water  to  make  two  ounces;   dose  one  teaspoonful  every  four  houri." 

Lungs,  Inflammation  of  (Pneumonia;  Pleurisy — Inflammation  of  the 
Investing  Membrane  of  the  Lungs,  and  that  which  lines  the  Chest-CaYity — 
&c.) — On  this  subject  I  give  Dalziel's  treatment  complete. 

These  two  diseases  are  sometimes  co-existent,  when  it  is  known  as 
pleuro-pneumonia.  It  would  be  too  much  to  expect  an  amateur  to  distin- 
guish between  them;  but  as  the  causes  and  treatment  are  much  the  same, 
I  shall  continue  to  treat  them  as  one  disease.  This  disease  is  of  very  com- 
mon occurrence  in  dogs,  and  in  many  cases  proves  fatal.  When  it  exists  as 
a  complication  of  distemper  it  is  known  as  "chest  distemper;"  but  other 
Of  the  respiratory  organs  may  be  involved. 

The  causes  producing  inflammation  of  the  lungs  are  generally  exposure 
to  gevere  cold,  allowing  dogs  to  swim  during  inclement  weather,  clipping 
dogs  or  otherwise  removing  a  greater  part  of  their  natural  covering,  or 
washing  them  and  afterwards  exposing  them  to  excessive  cold,  especially 
If  not  thoroughly  dried.  In  fact,  any  sudden  transition  from  a  high  to 
a  low  temperature  may  produce  it,  especially  in  dogs  of  a  delicate  consti- 
tution and  unused  to  roughing  it.  Again,  it  may  occur  from  over-exertion 
through  running  too  far,  or  from  fractured  ribs  penetrating  the  lung-tissue. 

The  more  notable  symptoms  are  quick  and  labored  breathing,  the  in* 
spirations  being  full,  the  expirations  short,  and  the  breath  hot.  The  dog 
sits  on  his  haunches,  and  if  obliged  to  move  doeg  so  reluctantly,  and  soon 
resumes  that  position,  with  his  head  pushed  forward.  The  ribs  are  mora 
or  less  fixed,  and  the  abdominal  muscles  brought  Into  action,  especially  If 
pleurisy  is  present.  The  fixed  position  of  the  ribs,  with  the  heaving  of  the 
flanks,  is  a  most  characteristic  symptom  of  pleurisy.  In  affections  of  the 
lungs,  the  animal  stands  with  its  legs  (fore  legs)  wide  apart.  If  the  dis- 
ease progresses,  the  face  has  a  haggard  expression,  the  angle  of  the  mouth 
is  drawn  up,  and  the  extremities  become  deathly  cold.  If  not  relieved,  the 
dog  rapidly  gets  worse,  and  the  breathing  becomes  more  labored  and  painful. 

Pleurisy,  or  inflammation  of  the  investing  membrane  of  the  lungs,  often 
exists  independently,  or  as  a  complication  of  pneumonia.  To  treat  this 
disease  with  any  chance  of  success  it  is  important  that  the  dog  should  be 
kept  where  he  can  freely  breathe  fresh,  cool,  a!r;  a  hot.  stiflin*  place  is 
equally  to  be  avoided  with  a  damp  or  draughty  one.    Whilst  cool,  fresh  air 


 

i«  insured,  the  patient  must  at  the  same  time  be  kept  warm  by  clothing:  if 
necessary;  it  is  also  needful  that  he  should  be  as  little  distrubed  as  possible. 
If  the  legs  are  cold,  woollen  bandages  should  be  placed  on  all  of  them.  The 
diet  should  be  rather  low  at  first,  but  not  too  much  so — broth,  gruel,  etc., 
are  suitable  under  the  circumstances. 

In  the  way  of  medicines,  it  is  necessary  that  the  bowels  should  be  kept 
open  by  castor  oil  or  the  use  of  clysters.  The  Fever  Mixture — which  find 
given  under  Catarrh,  should  be  immediately  and  diligently  administered. 

Blisters  to  the  sides,  as  sometimes  advised,  are  bad,  as  they  cause 
soreness  and  increase  the  pain  in  breathing.  Hot -linseed  poultices  should 
alone  be  employed  throughout  the  day  and  night.  If  the  fever  is  high,  give 
%  to  1  drop  of  tincture  of  aconite  every  fifteen  minutes  for  two  hours,  then 
hourly  for  eight  hours. 

Dogs  recovering  from  this  disease  are  always  very  weak,  and  require 
very  great  care  to  prevent  a  relapse,  even  when  all  danger  appears  to  be 
gone.  Only  the  most  gentle  exercise  should  be  allowed  at  first,  and  fine 
weather  selected  for  it.  The  dog  will  require  nourishing  diet,  which  should 
be  plain,  and  consist  for  a  time  of  broths,  etc.  a  return  to  solid  food 
being  gradual.  The  dog  will  at  this  stage  be  greatly  benefited  by  tonics 
and  to  build  him  up  use  either  Eberhart's  Tonic  Pills,  or  Sergeant's  Con- 
dition Pills. 

Mange — A  troublesome,  and,  in  some  forms,  the  most  loathsome  dis- 
ease met  with  in  the  dog,  occurring  in  so  many  forms  as  to  be  not  always 
easy  of  distinction.  The  trouble  with  too  many  dog  owners  is,  that,  when 
any  skin  trouble  appears  they  are  most  likely  to  call  it  Mange.  Mange  and 
Eczema  are  too  often  confounded,  and,  as  there  is  a  decided  difference, 
mange  being  a  skin  trouble,  due  to  a  parasite,  while  eczema  is  a  blood 
trouble,  the  two  diseases  require  different  treatment.  The  term  mange,  as 
applied  to  animals,  is  identical  with  itch  in  the  human  race,  in  both  of 
which  exist  parasite  life  in  the  skin,  and  is  a  cutaneous  disease.  The  very 
pronounced  distinction  between  true  mange  and  eczema,  and  other  causes 
of  irritation  of  the  skin,  is  that  mange  is  caused  by  a  parasite  invisible  to 
the  naked  eye,  and  that  it  is  transferable  by  contact,  from  one  animal  to 
another,  while  eczema,  blotch,  surfiet  or  red  mange,  is  not.  And,  while  a 
whole  kennel  may  be  suffering  from  the  latter  compalints,  it  must  be  be- 
cause all  have  been  subjected  to  conditions  of  life  occasioning  derange- 
ment of  the  system,  eczema  remains  an  individual  disease,  and  is  never 
transmitted.  True  mange  resembles  itch  in  man,  as  it  is  due  to  a  small 
parasite  that  burrows  or  tunnels  through  the  skin  in  all  directions,  draw- 
ing its  nourishment  therefrom.  The  female  deposits  her  eggs  In  the  canals 
formed,  which  hatch  out  in  about  two  weeks;  the  young  continue  bur- 
rowing and  occasion  intense  itching.  True  mange  is  entirely  a  local  affec- 
tion, and  the  uneasiness  and  loss  of  sleep  causes  the  animal  to  continually 
scratch  and  bite  itself  in  Its  vain  efforts  to  allay  the  intolerable  pain  and 
itching.  This  has  a  very  debilitating  effect  upon  the  system,  and  will  soon 
transform   a   healthy  and  sleek   coated  pet  into  a  loathsome  object. 

The  cause  is  invariably  the  result  of  having   met  some  dog  or  other 
animal  that  w*§  affected  with  mange.    One  dog  meeting  another  or  occu- 




pying  his  kennel  or  sleeping  quarters,  or  being  shipped  in  a  crate  that 
was  used  by  a  dog  with  mango,  will  surely  contract  it.  Absolute  clean- 
liness is  necessary  in  the  treatment  of  mange.  When  your  dog  shows 
signs  of  mange,  remove  it  immediately  from  its  quarters  to  new  ones, 
burn  the  bedding  it  has  used,  wash  its  kennel  with  boiling  water,  to  which 
has  been  added  the  Standard  Disinfectant,  or  Sanitas  (See  advertisement 
of  both  in  this  book).  Either  one,  if  thoroughly  applied,  will  destroy 
every  parasite  in  the  kennel. 

Now  give  your  dog  a  good  bath  with  Eberhart's  Dog  Soap,  using  quite  as 
Warm  water  as  the  dog  c ■ : i ii  stand,  cleansing  its  entire  body  and  opening  the 
pores  of  the  skin.  After  drying  the  dog  thoroughly,  then  apply  Eberhart's 
Skin  Cure  all  over  the  dog,  rubbing  it  in  well  with  your  bands  and  not. 
missing  a  spot  on  tbe  dog's  body,  for  if  yon  do  you  leave  some  parasites 
— a  very  busy  and  industrious  pest  they  are — and  in  a  day  later  many  new- 
born ones  would  be  hard  at  work  again.  Take  plenty  Of  lime  in  putting 
on  'this  skin  cure,  using  "plenty  of  elbow  grease,*'  applying  it  the  same 
as  you  would  a  liniment.  Repeal  this  the  next  day,  and  probably  Eor  two 
days  more,  the  bath  not  being  strictly  essential  except  the  first  day.  If 
you  wish,  or  the  dog  is  a  house  dog.  you  can  give  It  a  bath  after  the  skin 
cure  has  been  on  for  ball'  an  hour,  for  it  has  then  done  its  work,  this  bath 
simply  to  put  the  dog  in  more  presentable  and  cleaner  shape,  as  all  skin 
or  mange  cures  contain  oil  of  some  kind  and  are  therefore  greasy.  There 
are  several   good   mange  cures  aside   I'tom   mine. 

Ordinarily  a  case  of  mange  should  be  cured  in  a  week  or  two,  and 
after  three  or  four  applications  all  over  the  dog,  it  is  only  necessary  to 
apply  it  daily  to  the  sore  places,  or  where  no  hair,  as  my  skin  remedy  is, 
also,  a  great  hair  grower,  and  never  fails  to  restore  the  hair,  unless  tbe 
hair  roots  have  been  destroyed — when  nothing  will  bring  back  the  hair. 
It  is  not  necessary  to  change  the  food  in  treating  mange. 

A  very  good  mange  euro  is  the  following: 

Train  oil    ""4    gallon 

Venice  turpentine    2  ounces 

Oil   of  tar    y2    ounce 

Lac   Sulphur    • 1   pound 

First  mix  the  oil  and  turpentine  and  then  add  the  oil  of  tar  and  sulphur. 
Your  druggist  may  not  have  train  oil,  as  it  is  often  hard  to  procure.  If  so, 
common    "black    oil"    or    crude    petroleum    will    do   just   as   well. 

All  mange  cures  should   bo  applied   the  same  as  directed  in  vising  mine. 

■"■""he  following,  as  a  dip,  was  recommended  by  a  friend,  who  used  it  in 
his  kem.ols.  The  only  objection  I  can  see  is  that  it  would  not  do  to  use 
in  cold  weather: 

"For  quick  cure  of  mange  use  1  quart  of  Standard  Oil  of  Tar  to  10 
quarts  of  water;  have  water  as  hot  as  possible  without  scalding  or  burning 
band,  mix  thoroughly,  place  liquid  In  small  narrow  tub,  one  that  will  just 
f»l  the  dog  if  possible;  place  dog  In  tub,  take  >.  cup  and  pour  the  liquid  all 
ovur  him,  Beginning  at  head,  just  below  ears;  saturate  dog  thoroughly, 
loosen  up  all  old  scabs,  applying  well  tbe  eure  to  affected  parts.    Take  stiff 


 

brush,  wet  with  liquid,  brush  dog  thoroughly;  remove  dog  from  tub,  give 
him  a  bed  of  clean  straw  to  roll  in,  do  not  rinse  off  with  clean  water  or 
rub  skin  dry.  Do  not  allow  dog  to  roll  in  dirt  immediately  after  his 
wash,  as  he  will  if  not  chained  up  or  placed  in  a  room.  Rolling  in  sand 
after  a  wash  will  irritate  the  sores  and  make  the  cure  all  the  harder.  When 
about  dry.  the  sore  spots  may  be  touched  up  with  equal  parts  of  water 
and  Standard  Oil  of  Tar.  In  curing  mange,  the  bedding  must  be  changed 
every  day,  wash  all  woodwork  where  dog  rubs,  once  every  week  with  hot 
waicr  in   which  has  been  placed   Standard   Oil   of  Tar." 

There  is  no  use  in  taking  medicine  unless  you  follow  your  doctor's 
advice,  so  don't  expect  the  desired  result  unless  you  follow  directions,  as 
one  or  two  applications  will  not  effect  a  cure  in  a  case  Of  mange.  Mange 
can  be  cured,  no  matter  how  bad  a  case  it  appears  to  be,  if  you  go  at  it 
right  and  have  the  right  remedy,  in  fact,  it  is  one  of  the  easiest  to  cure  of 
all  troubles.  The  reason  why  so  many  people  dread  this  disease  is  be- 
cause of  their  failure  to  cure  what  they  wrongly  suppose  is  mange,  when 
it  perhaps  is  eczema,  which  is  a  much  longer  story,  but  can  also  be  cured 
and  the  treatment  of  which  is  given  under  that  heading.  Remember,  that* 
if  you  have  more  than  one  dog,  the  others  will  get  it  unless  the  afflicted 
one  is  removed  and  isolateu  in  time.  The  advantage  of  having  a  regular 
kennel  or  place  for  each  dog  to  sleep  is  manifest  in  treating  the  dog  for 
mange,  as  thus  you  can  disinfect  his  kennel  and  destroy  the  bedding,  which 
are  both  infected,  whereas,  if  your  dog  was  sleeping  any  place  he  wanted 
to  in  your  house,  this  would  be  a  very  difficult  matter,  and  while  you  cured 
him  he  could  again  contract  it  by  coming  in  contact  with  the  parasites  that 
had    not    been    destroyed. 

You  need  not  have  any  fear  of  con  i  racting  mange  from  your  dog; 
I  have  treated  many  cases  for  years  past  and  never  got  it — not  transmit- 
able  from  the  dog  to  man. 

There  are  several  skin  diseases  called  by  different  names,  or  desig- 
nated as  different  kinds  of  mange,  but  the  treatment  I  have  given  for 
mange,  and  the  one  for  eczema,  about  covers  the  whole  ground  of  skin 
trouble,  or,  my  remedy  will  cure  them  all,  excepting  that  in  some  of  them,  as 
in  eczema,  internal  remedies  must  also  be  used  at  the  same  time  to  work 
on  the  blood.  Eczema  is  fully  treated  elsewhere.  Carbolic  acid  is  used 
in  many  mange  cures,  a  dangerous  ingredient  unless  carefully  used  and 
in    small    quantities. 

My  long-time  friend,  Harry  \Y.  Lacy,  editor  of  American  Fancier  and 
Stock-keeper,   has   this   to   say   of   mange      read    it    also: 

"It  is  quite  true  that  eczema  or  red  mange  is  to  some  extent  con- 
tagious, but  we  have  not  found  it  to  be  so  to  any  extent  which  would  justify 
the  term  being  applied  to  it.  It  is  desirable,  always  to  keep  a  dog  affected 
with  skin  disease  away  from  other  dogs,  because  constant  contact  in  the 
kennel  or  at  play  is  liable  to  give  rise  to  an  exchange  of  skin  complaint. 
On  the  other  hand,  a  dog  with  distemper,  which  is  very  contagious,  is  made 
to  give  it  to  animals  which  never  come  mar  to  him,  and  a  dog  with 
fleas  will  furnish  a  supply  to  ail  his  fellows  in  the  neighborhood.  In  most 
cases  mange  is,  however,  not  due  to  contact  by  the  victim  with  another 
mangy  cur,  but  is  due  to  out-and-out  neglect.  Mange  is  never  known  in 
kennels  where  the  dogs  are  properly  looked  after;  it  is  a  cultivation  of  the 


back-yard,  and  thrives  best  upon  the  poor  chained-up  brute  that  is  more 
human  than  his  owner  who  keeps  him  chained  there'.  In  a  word,  filth  ia 
the  soil   on  which  alone  the  sarcoptic  parasite  can  thrive. 

"A  dog  with  ordinary  skin  irritation,  developing  into  redness  and 
rash,  has  acquired  that  in  one  of  two  ways.  Either  he  has  an  hereditary 
predisposition  to  skin  complaint  (and  here  let  it  be  said  that  this  heredi- 
tary predisposition  is  a  very  common  fact,  and  is  due  undoubtedly  in  a 
great  measure  to  the  in-breeding  which  has  been  carried  on  to  a  greater  or 
less  extent  in  all  breeds)  or  else  he  is  suffering  from  impurity  in  the  blood 
which  may  be  clue  to  over-feeding  or  liver  complaint  or  want  of  sufficient 
exercise  or  any  one  of  a  dozen  other  things.  If  the  former  be  the  case  it  is 
by  no  means  probable  that  a  cure  will  be  effected,  and  the  most  important 
thing  that  can  be  done  is  in  the  direction  of  preventing  the  disease  from 
being  handed  down  to  other  generations.  If  it  is  intended  to  breed  from 
the  dog  it  should  be  mated  with  the  newest  blood  possible — that  is  to  say 
with  an  animal  having  a  very  different  pedigree  from  its  own.  The  disease 
is  certain  to  reappear  even  after  the  dog  has  been  apparently  cured.  A 
^hange  of  diet  or  of  weather  will  always  be  liable  to  precipitate  a  fresh 
attack." 

The  following  treatise  on  mange  was  written  by  Dalziel,  and  to  it  your 
attention  is  called.     A  very  able  handling  of  the  subject: 

Sarcoptic  Mange — The  mite  producing  this  most  nearly  resembles  the 
itch-mite  of  man,  and  as  it  is  propagated  by  eggs,  and  transmitted  by 
contact,  direct  or  indirect,  there  seems  nothing  impossible  in  the  idea  of 
stamping  out  this  chief  "enemy  to  the  comfort  of  a  brave  spaniel,"  if  only 
we  could  get  every  clog  owner  to  be  careful  and  clean.  There  is  much  virtue 
in  an  "if;"  but  at  least  we  can  learn  from  the  facts  about  the  mange-mite 
that  we  need  not  harbor  it  in  our  own  kennels,  and  by  stamping  it  out 
there,  lessen  it  generally.  Dirt  unquestionably  harbors  and  encourages 
mange,  although  it  does  not  produce  it;  left  undisturbed  by  cleansing  pro- 
cesses,  the   pests   breed   and   multiply  with   great   rapidity. 

When  the  mite  reaches  the  dog,  it  burrows  into  the  skin;  the  pro- 
cess, and  also  a  poisonous  fluid  discharged  by  the  creature,  causes  intol- 
erable itching,  and  to  relieve  this  the  dog  scratches,  with  the  result  that 
the  skin  is  broken,  small  red  points  appear,  and  these  become  pustular 
and  discharge  a  fluid  which  dries  or  crusts  and  forms  a  scab;  the  hair 
falls  off.  The  multiplication  of  the  original  cause  of  the  evil  is  rapid,  and, 
left  unchecked,  the  whole  surface  of  the  body  soon  becomes  involved, 
while  the  poor  dog  is  an  object  of  pity,  and  from  want  of  rest  and  other 
causes  sinks  into  a  helpless  condition.  This  state  is  often  called  virulent 
or  scabby  mange,  and  presents  many  of  the  characteristics  of  Blotch.  The 
skin  is  harsh,  dry,  and  rough,  until  small  pimples  appear,  when  therefrom 
oozes  a  purulent  matter,  forming  scabs,  which  mat  the  hair  together,  and 
bring  it  off  in  patches  as  the  dog  rubs  or  scratches  himself.  The  back, 
breast,  and  inside  of  the  thighs  are  generally  the  first  places  attacked,  and 
every  crease  and  wrinkle  in  the  skin  becomes  inflamed  and  moist  with  the 
irritating  discharge.  If  the  disease  is  left  unchecked,  it  soon  extends  over 
the  whole  body,  reducing  the  dog  to  a  deplorable  condition,  disgusting  to 
all  who  see  him  and  intolerable  to  himself.  These  are  severe  and  extreme 
eases.     In  others  a  dry,  scurfy  mange  exists,  marked  by  little  red  spots, 


'    ~   

and  confined  to  the  joints  of  the  legs,  over  the  eyes,  the  flaps  of  the  ears, 
etc.:  and  this  may  exist  for  some  time  without  other  damage  than  causing 
the  dog  great  uneasiness  and  injury  to  his  appearance  by  partially  destroy- 
ing the  hair  and  robbing  it  of  its  natural  glossy  appearance. 

The  first  thing  to  be  done  with  a  mangy  dog  is  to  wash  him.  Let  him 
have  a  good  sousing  and  scrubbing  with  a  good  soap  and  water,  "hottish 
rather  but  not  so  boiling  as  to  turn  him  red;"  dry  well  with  a  soft  cloth, 
which  mast  immediately  be  boiled,  and  then  dress  him  with  one  or  the 
other  of  the  several  well  known  mange  cures.  Whatever  you  use,  see  that 
it  is  applied  thoroughly;  see  that  it  reaches  the  skin  where  the  mites  are, 
and  is  not  merely  left  on  the  hair.  Chronic  cases  of  mange  often  take  a 
month  or  two  to  cure.  Sulphur  is  given  as  an  internal  remedy  for  mange, 
but  it  is  not  of  any  use,  in  mange. 

Follicular  Mango  is  due  to  another  mite  (Demodex  folloculorum),  very 
different  in  appearance  from  the  other  (Saroptes),  which  are  short  and 
thick,  whereas  this,  the  Demodex,  is  elongated,  and  with  a  long,  obtuse 
tail.  These  parasites  differ  in  their  habits,  the  Demodex  living  in  the 
hair-follicles,  and  burrowing  deep  under  the  skin  in  the  sebaceous  gland 
that  supplies  the  unctous  matter  to  protect  the  skin  and  keep  it  soft. 
The  depth  to  which  the  Demodex  burrows  renders  Follicular  Mange  much 
lets  easy  of  transmission  between  dogs;  but  it  also  makes  a  cure  much 
more  difficult,  as  the  parasites  are  hard  to  reach.  This  mite  is  identical 
with  a  parasite  found  in  the  human  skin  causing  some  disfiguration  of 
the  face,  but  further  than  that  it  does  no  harm  until  transferred  to  the 
dog,  when  it  causes  a  most  repulsive  disease,  and  one  very  difficult  to 
•radicate. 

Some  few  yean  ago  Mr.  Wm.  Hunting,  F.R.S.V.S.,  in  conjunction  with 
Profes»or  Duguid,  made  a  series  of  investigations  and  experiments  in  eluci- 
dation of  this  disease,  and  the  following  description  of  symptoms  and 
the  diagnosis  are  from  an  article  by  the  former  gentleman,  which  appeared 
in  the  Veterinary  Journal,  and  afterward  in  pamphlet  form: 

"The  symptoms  of  the  disease  are  seldom  seen  in  the  first  stages;  they 
consist  merely  of  circumscribed  spots  from  which  the  hair  fallsy  and  upon 
which  are  noticeable  a  few  small  pimples.  These  patches  extend  rapidly,  and 
fresh  ones  appear  on  other  parts.  Any  portion  of  the  skin  may  be  affected, 
but  the  head,  legs,  belly,  and  sides,  are  usually  the  seat  of  the  disease. 
The  affected  places  are  almost  hairless,  and  what  hair  remains  is  easily 
pulled  out;  small  pimples  and  pustules  stud  the  surface,  the  latter  varying 
in  size  from  a  pin's  head  to  that  of  a  pea.  The  confluence  of  the  pustules, 
and  the  discharge  of  their  contents,  give  rise  to  scabs;  these  crack  and 
bleed,  and  so  produce  a  most  repulsive  appearance.  In  white-haired  dogs 
Ihe  skin  is  red;  in  all  it  is  extremely  hot,  and  emits  an  unpleasant  odor. 
The  irritation  does  not  excite  much  scratching,  but  the  dog  frequently 
shakes  himself.  More  pain  than  itshing  seems  to  accompany  the  disease. 
In  cases  where  the  whole  body  is  affected  loss  of  condition  is  most  marked; 
and  in  cold  weather  the  almost  total  loss  of  hair  may  cause  death,  if  the 
animal  be  not  kept  in  a  warm  place.  This  stage,  too,  is  always  accom- 
panied by  ravenous  appetite,  due,  probably,  to  the  rapid  loss  of  animal 
heat. 




"Diagnosis. — In  white  clogs  the  color  of  the  skin  may  cause  the  disease 
to  be  mistaken  for  'Red  Mange'  or  'Eczema.'  The  circumscribed  spots  in 
the  first  stages  may  be  confounded  with  some  forms  of  Tinea,  and  the  loss 
of  hair  and  the  presence  of  scabs  seen  in  the  fully  developed  disease  may 
easily  be  mistaken  for  ordinary  scabies.  The  pustules,  the  heat  of  the  skin, 
and  the  comparatively  slight  itchiness  shown,  are,  however,  nearly  diagnos- 
tic. Positive  diagnosis  can  only  be  made  by  the  aid  of  the  microscope  and 
the  detection  of  the  parasite.  If  we  puncture  one  of  the  pustules,  and  mix 
its  contents  on  a  slide  with  a  little  water,  the  acari  are  easily  discovered. 
I  have  found  as  many  as  thirty  to  one  pustule.  Sometimes  we  may  detect 
them  on  the  root  of  a  hair  removed  from  an  affected  spot.  With  a  low 
power,  the  parasites  somewhat  resemble  sprats  or  minnows,  but  a  higher 
power  shows  them  to  consist  of  a  head  and  body,  which  latter  terminates 
in  a  long  and  obtusely  pointed  tail.  They  are  furnished  with  six  or  eight 
legs  situated  on  the  anterior  part  of  the  body,  three  or  four  on  each  side. 
The  head  consists  of  two  antennse  and  a  median  proboscis,  all  of  which 
are  capable  of  being  moved  forward  or  backward.  The  legs  consist  of 
three  segments.  The  movements  of  the  creatures  are  not  often  seen,  and 
are  very  slow.  The  parasite  measures  about  one-hundredth  of  an  inch  in 
length  by  one  five-hundredth  in  breadth." 

"In  regard  to  treatment,  Fleming,  in  Veterinary  Sanitary  Science,  says 
"The  situation  of  the  Demodex  renders  it  almost  inaccessible  to  parasi- 
tical remedies;  the  disease  it  engenders  is  therefore  looked  upon  as  ex- 
tremely troublesome,  and,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  almost  beyond  a  cure. 
Often,  when  it  is  believed  to  be  extinguished,  it  reappears  in  all  its  viru- 
lence in  one  or  two  months.  Nevertheless,  Zurn  asserts  that  he  has  fre- 
quently succeeded  with  an  ointment  composed  of  1  part  of  benzine  to  4 
parts  of  lard.  Zundel  states  that  the  balsam  of  Peru  has  often  yielded 
good  results  when  the  malady  has  not  been  of  too  long  duration;  he  has 
employed  it  dissolved  in  alcohol  (1  to  30)." 

Symptoms  of  Scaroptic  Mange. — In  pronounced  cases  this  disease  is 
easily  recognizable,  but  in  the  initial  stages,  when  the  hair  is  not  much 
lost  or  broken,  if  complicated  with  eczema — which  is  not  uncommon — 
diagnosis  is  more  difficult. 

The  first  symptom  is  that  of  great  irritation  of  the  affected  parts, 
especially  on  the  application  of  heat. 

The  symptoms  first  appear  in  the  form  of  small  red  spots,  which  may 
be  seen  on  the  head,  close  to  the  muzzle,  the  outside  of  the  roots  of  the 
ears,  round  the  eyes  and  neck,  the  bottom  part  of  the  chest,  the  elbows, 
the  soft  skin  of  the  stomach,  behind  the  thighs  and  the  feet. 

As  a  matter  of  fact,  it  may  appear  on  any  part  of  the  body.  The 
small  red  spots  resemble  flea  bites  on  the  human  skin.  These  red  spots 
are  more  noticeable  when  situated  on  the  stomach  or  inside  the  thighs. 

Little  blisters  appear  in  place  of  the  red  spots,  and  if  they  are  in 
large  numbers  and  burst  open  sores  appear. 

Injury  will  result  from  an  inoculation  of  the  skin  with  the  contents 
of  the  blisters,  which  often  occurs  as  a  result  of  scratching  or  rubbing. 

Doss  of  hair  will  follow  this,  and  is  caused  partly  by  the  scratching 
and  partly  by  the  scaling  of  the  crusts  of  the  skin  caused  by  the  small 
blisters  and  pimples. 


Te  skin  then  becomes  thickened  and  hardened.  In  neglected  cases  the 
general  health  is  very  much  affected,  as  the  animal  gets  little  rest,  and 
in  weakly  subjects  generally  results  fatally. 

Scaroptic  Mange  is  very  readily  communicated  to  the  human  subject, 
and  is  the  cause  in  most  cases  of  what  is  termed  "Scabbies,"  and  is  far  more 
common  than  is  generally  supposed.  But  Scaroptic  Mange  is  comparatively 
easy  to  cure  if  taken  in  hand  rightly.  It  is  a  waste  of  time  to  simply 
apply  a  mange  cure  to  the  affected  parts.  To  complete  a  cure  you  must 
treat  your  dog  internally  as  well  as  externally  or  you  will  never  have  a 
perfect  cure. 

Here  is  where  I  should  try  Eberhart's  Skin  Remedy — and  for  the 
blood,  use  internally,  the  White  Sulphur,  as  advised  for  Eczema.  (See 
Eczema). 

Mouth,  Canker  of  the — This  is  generally  the  result  of  dainty  feeding 
and  lack  of  exercise,  but  in  old  dogs  it  may  come  from  failing  teeth  and  want 
of  masticating  power.  Either  or  both  of  these  causes  lead  to  disordered 
stomach  and  foul  breath;  a  deposit  of  tartar  takes  place,  the  gums  and 
lips  becoming  red,  inflamed,  and  spongy,  and  after  a  time  a  fetid  discharge 
from  the  mouth,  and  often  accompanied  with  bleeding.  Old  animals  are 
most  subject  to  this  trouble,  and  by  examining  you  will  probably  find  some 
decayed  teeth,  the  gums  being  so  tender  that  in  attempting  to  eat,  the 
dog  suffers  great  pain,  which  he  will  show  by  his  trying  to  chew  the  food 
for  a  minute,  roll  it  about  in  his  mouth  and  then  drop  it. 

To  cure  the  disease,  remove  the  cause.  If  you  have  been  cramming  the 
dog  with  delicacies,  return  to  a  sensible  way  of  feeding  and  give  proper 
exercise.  Examine  his  mouth  carefully  for  decayed  teeth,  and,  if  found, 
remove  them  and  the  rotten  stumps  with  a  pair  of  suitable  forceps.  This 
is  not  so  difficult  and  you  can  do  it  by  having  some  one  hold  the  dog's 
head  firmly,  and  can  be  done  more  easily  than  may  be  supposed,  a  very 
little  practice  making  any  one  efficient.  While  his  mouth  is  in  such  a 
tender  state  he  must  have  food  that  requires  no  chewing,  as  well  as  to 
keep  correct  his  disordered  stomach.  A  vegetable  diet  is  now  the  thing. 
Give  him  quite  a  brisk  dose  of  the  following  pills: 

Podophyllin     6   grains 

Compound  extract  of  colocynth 30   grains 

Powdered    rhubarb    48  grains 

Extract  of  henbane   36   grains 

Mix,  and  divide  into  twenty-four  pills.     Give  for  grown   dogs  from 
two  to  four  pills,  according  to  size. 

After  a  dose  of  this,  then  use  the  following: 

Extract  of  gentian    1   dram        i. 

Powdered    rhubarb    3  6   grains 

Carbonate  of  soda 12   grains 

Gum  acacia  sufficient  to  make  into  twelve  10-grain  pills. 




Very  small   toy  dogs  should   have  half  a  pill.      Give  these   twice   a 
day  until  all  the  symptoms  have  disappeared. 

A  most  excellent  wash  for  the  mouth  in  order  to  remove  the  unpleasant 
smell,  is  a  solution  6f  chlorinated  soda,  diluted  with  twenty-four  to  thirty 
times  its  volume  of  water.  Wash  out  the  mouth  freely  with  this  several 
times  a  day. 

The  following  will  harden  the  gums  and  assist  in  bringing  them  to  a 
healthy  state:  Take  powdered  alum,  %  ounce;  simple  tincture  of  myrrh,  1 
ounce;  dissolve  the  alum  in  a  pint  of  water  and  add  the  tincture  of  myrrh. 

The  ulcers  that  occur  upon  the  gums  should  be  touched  with  a  10  per 
cent  solution  of  nitrate  of  silver. 

Milk-Glands,  Inflammation  of  the. — See  Mammltis. 

Meningitis. — See  Brain,  Inflammation  of  the. 

Milk,  Absence  of. — This  trouble  Is  quite  too  often  met  with  in  bitches, 
I  regret  to  say.  Usually  the  result  of  weakness,  obesity,  or  disease  of  the 
mammary  glands.  It  sometimes  is  luckily  only  temporary,  and  the  secre- 
tion can  be  restored  with  friction  to  the  glands  with  the  hand.  The  fol- 
lowing can  be  given  to  weakly  bitches: 

Tincture  cinchonae  co 1  ounce 

Liquor   cinchonae    V2  dram 

Spirits-  of  ammonia  aromatic   %  ounce 

Water,   to   make    6  ounces 

Dose,  a  teaspoonful  to  a  tablespoonful  three  times  daily,  according 
to  size  of  bitch. 

Maw-AVorms. — See  Worms. 

Mammltis,  (Inflammation  of  the  Milk-Glands)  frequently  occurs.  Caus- 
es are,  retention  of  milk,  the  result  of  taking  away  the  puppies  immediately 
after  born,  or  too  early,  or  from  their  death,  or  cold  or  injuries.  Symp- 
toms are  a  redness  and  tenderness  of  the  parts,  the  milk  is  curdled,  and 
often  puss  or  blood  accompanies  it,  the  former  if  abscesses  have  formed. 
Very  highly  important  that  such  cases  should  be  attended  to  at  once.  As 
quick  as  first  symptoms  are  noticed  foment  the  parts  with  warm  water 
during  the  day,  being  careful  to  dry  well  afterward.  If  caused  by  the 
retention  of  milk  by  the  bitch  having  lost  her  puppies,  or  they  were  taken 
away  from  her,  the  milk  must  be  drawn  away  frequently  by  the  hands.  ' 
Where  possible,  and  the  bitch  will  permit,  a  puppy  should  be  given  her. 
Give  her  one  to  two  drams  of  epsom  salts  with  from  ten  to  twenty  grains 
of  bicarbonate  of  soda  twice  daily  in  water,  until  the  bowels  are  well 
relaxed.  By  adopting  this  treatment  in  the  early  stages  the  inflammation 
will  usually  subside  and  the  gland  regain  its  normal  condition.  Pus  or 
matter  will  accumulate  in  protracted  cases,  and  abscesses  form.    The  latter 




must  be  eradiated  by  lancing,  and  boracic  acid  lotion  or  ointment  applied 
to  the  part  nigbt  and  morning,  and  to  prevent  her  from  licking  it  she 
should  have  a  muzzle  with  a  piece  of  canvas  sewn  over  the  front.  Where 
abscesses  have  formed,  patches  of  the  gland  will  generally  become  obliter- 
ated, and  of  no  further  use.  Mammitis  does  sometimes  assume  a  chronic 
form,  the  glands  become  enlarged  and  indurated. 

Milk  Fever  (Parturient  Apoplexy)  is  uncommon  in  the  bitch.  There  is 
clanger  of  causing  it  by  robbing  her  of  all  her  puppies,  especially  if  she  has 
plenty  of  milk,  in  a  case  of  where  she  has  got  out  on  you  and  bred  by  mistake 
to  some  common  dog.  Drown  all  but  one  puppy  as  soon  as  born,  if  you  don't 
want  to  raise  them,  but  leave  one  to  nurse  for  a  week  or  so. 

The  Symptoms  are  apparent  weakness,  staggering,  quick  hard  breath- 
ing, hot  dry  nose  and  tongue,  the  tongue  furred;  the  milk  is  suppressed, 
and  the    bitch  shows  extreme  thirst. 

Treatment — Apply  ice  to  the  head,  if  possible;  if  not,  then  cold  water 
often  relieves  the  bowels  by  clysters.  Keep  her  quiet  and  as  little  disturbed 
as  can  be,  a  soft  bed  provided  so  the  head  will  be  somewhat  elevated.  This 
is  very  important.  Also  give  Glover's  and  Clayton's  Distemper  Cure  every 
two  or  three  hours  in  teaspoonful  doses  for  ordinary  sized  dogs,  for  a  day 
■or  two,  until  she  is  better,  which  will  allay  the  fever.  The  bitch  should 
be  milked  two  or  three  times  a  day.  If  a  caked  breast  appears  treat  this 
as  prescribed  under  that  heading.  In  Milk  Fever  when  the  bitch  is  uncon- 
scious, nourishment,  such  as  brandy  and  milk,  can  be  given  her  rectum. 
The  bladder  must  be  emptied  by  means  of  the  catheter. 

Navel  Hernia,  or  Rupture. — An  enlargement  of  the  navel,  often  met 
with  in  puppies,  and  may  be  simply  an  expansion  of  the  same,  or  cicatrice. 
Navel  hernia  is  the  protrusion  of  a  portion  of  the  intestine — the  membra- 
neous covering  of  the  bowels.  It  may  be  caused  by  extra  strain  at  birth 
on  the  umbilical  cord,  or  the  tongue  of  the  mother  may  extend  the  wound. 
It  is  a  soft,  movable  tumor  over  the  navel,  varying  in  size,  and  most  prom- 
inent when  the  stomach  and  bowels  are  full.  I  have  seen  it  occur  in  pup- 
pies, but  so  slight  that  I  did  not  do  anything  for  them,  it  doing  no  harm, 
and  only  leaving  a  small  lump  that  was  never  noticed  as  they  grew  up, 
the  hair  on  the  belly  hiding  it.  In  treating  puppies  for  it,  wait  till  they  are 
weaned  and  separated  from  their  mother,  or  she  will,  with  her  tongue, 
remove  or  displace  the  application.  Now  take  the  puppy  in  the  morn- 
ing, before  his  breakfast,  when  bowels  are  empty,  lay  him  on  his  back  on 
your  lap,  and  place  over  the  enlargement  a  pad  of  vulcanized  India  rubber  or 
cork,  tapered,  the  smaller  end  being  applied  on  the  tumor  after  it  has  been 
pressed  in,  and  the  pad  secured  by  strips  of  white  leather  smeared  with 
warm  pitch  plaster,  well  stuck  to  the  belly  so  pup  can  not  scratch  it  off  with 
its  feet.     A  cure  can  be  effected  in  a  few  weeks  if  the  pad  is  kept  in  place. 

Here  is  a  case  that  was  prescribed  for  by  Dent: 

"My  pointer  puppy,  ten  weeks  old,  strong  and  healthy,  has  a  rupture 
right  under  its  belly,  near  the  ribs  and  about  the  size  of  a  very  large  pea. 




Will  it  have  any  bad  effect  on  the  dog  after  being  cured?  Please  prescribe. 
Ans. — These  navel  ruptures  frequently  disappear  with  age  and  seldom 
cause  any  inconvenience.  If  you  want  to  operate  on  the  rupture,  lay  the 
dog  on  his  back,  pinch  the  skin  up  over  the  opening  in  the  walls  of  the 
abdomen  and  pass  two  pins  through  at  right  angles  to  each  other,  being 
careful  not  to  puncture  the  intestines;  then  tie  a  silk  cord  around  the  skin 
between  the  body  and  the  pins  and  allow  it  to  stay  there  until  it  sloughs 
off." 

Nephritis. — See  Kidneys,  Inflammation   of. 

Obesity. — See  Fatness,  Excessive. 

Ostitis  (Inflammation  of  the  Bone) This  is  generally  due  to  violence, 

blows,  or  to  constitutional  disturbance,  like  rheumatism  or  scrofula.  Symp- 
toms are  pain,  heat  and  swelling  of  the  skin  at  the  affected  part,  also  lame- 
ness. Very  essential  in  such  cases  is  rest,  combined  with  hot  fomenta- 
tions to  the  part  and  a  dose  of  aperient  medicine;  when  due  to  rheumatism, 
the  systemic  treatment  recommended  under  Rheumatism,  should. be  adopt- 
ed; and  should  there  be  an  enlargement  left  after  the  acute  inflammation 
has  subsided,  the  part  should  be  painted  daily  with  tincture  of  iodine,  unless 
soreness  is  produced,  when  this  treatment  should  cease  for  a  day  or  two. 

Ozoena. — This  complaint  shows  itself  by  a  discharge  from  both  nos- 
trils. The  causes  are  diseased  teeth,  protracted  catarrh,  causing  chronic 
inflammation  of  the  lining  membrane  of  the  nose,  polypi,  or  inflammation 
of  the  sinuses  of  the  nose,  due  to  the  presence  of  foreign  matter  in  that 
organ.  Where  the  disease  is  due  to  decayed  teeth,  the  latter  should  be 
extracted;  or  to  polypi,  these  should  be  removed.  The  nostrils  should  be 
syringed  night  and  morning  with  a  saturated  solution  of  boracic  acid;  or 
the  tincture  of  hydrastis  is  often  useful — 1  part  of  tincture  to  equal  parts 
of  water.     Exercise  and  fresh  air  are  very  necessary  to  recovery. 

Poisoning. — A  dastardly  act  is  to  poison  a  dog,  and  no  punishment  is 
too  severe  to  inflict  on  the  cowardly  cur  who  does  it.  If  I  could  have  my 
way  about  it,  the  cur  that  poisons  a  dog  would  hang  by  the  neck  till  he 
was  dead,  a  proper  punishment,  properly  fitting  the  crime.  If  you  are  so 
unfortunate  as  to  have  your  dog  poisoned,  keep  your  eye  open  on  your 
neighbors — who  perhaps  are  unfortunately  such  degenerates  that  they 
do  not  like  dogs.  Bide  your  time,  but  never  give  up  trying  to  land  the 
cur  who  poisoned  your  dog,  and  then,  if  you  can  not  have  positive  proof 
enough  to  punish  him  or  her  legally,  try  some  other  plan  quietly,  and 
never  give  up  until  you  have  in  some  way  punished  the  one  who  killed 
your  dog. 

I  am  devoting  considerable  space  to  this  subjett,  as  it  is  important, 
and  advise  that  you  study  this  article  well,  so  that  if  you  are  so  unfortunate 
as  to  ever  have  a  dog  poisoned,  you  may  know  what  to  do  promptly,  and 
perhaps  save  your  dog. 

It  may  be  of  service  to  some  readers  io  briefly  refer  to  a   few  of  the commoner  and  more  popularly  known  poisons  from  which  are  dogs  are 
most  likely  to  suffer;  and  I  think  the  following  will  cover  the  majority 
of  cases:  Arsenic,  cantharides,  carbolic  acid,  corrosive  sublimate,  phosphor- 
ous and  strychnine. 

As.  a  general  rule  for  distinguishing  between  the  evidence  of  poisoning 
and  the  symptoms  of  disease,  the  suddenness  of  the  attack  must  weigh 
largely;  while  by  tracing  where  the  dog  has  been,  and  what  he  has  or  is 
likely  to  have  picked  up,  a  pretty  accurate  conclusion  may  be  arrived  at. 

The  first  step  to  be  taken  in  most  cases  is  to  freely  empty  the  stomach 
by  means  of  emetics  such  as  tartar  emetic,  sulphate  of  zinc,  ipecacuanha 
wine,  one  of  the  most  useful  and  least  dangerous  to  use.  The  dose  is  from 
3  drams  to  8  drams  in  a  little  warm  water.  If  none  of  these  are  at  hand, 
by  drenching  with  lukewarm  water,  and  afterwards  giving  the  antidotes 
indicated  if  procurable. 

If  the  dog  suffer  much  pain,  a  dose  of  opium  or  laudanum  every  three 
or  four  hours.  Where  gieat  depression  and  weakness  follow,  stimulants, 
as  ether,  wine,  or  brandy,  should  be  given  in  small  quantities  at  frequent 
intervals. 

Arsenic  is  used  to  poison  rats,  mice  and  other  vermin;  in  this  way  it  is 
frequently  met  with  in  and  about  country  houses. 

Symptoms:  Great  heat  and  evident  pain  in  the  stomach  and  bowels, 
sometimes  accompanied  with  swelling — the  belly  being  very  tender  to  the 
touch — great  thirst,  frequent  vomiting  and  retching,  more  or  less  discharge 
of  a  frothy  saliva,  and  frequent  evacuations  of  fluid,  dark  colored  matter, 
often  marked  with  blood.  The  animal  soon  loses  muscular  power  to  a  great 
extent,  showing  an  indisposition  to  move;  the  tongue,  lips,  etc.,  are  red  and 
swollen,  and  the  breathing  is  more  and  more  labored  and  painful. 

Antidotes:  Ferrugo  or  hydrated  sesquioxide  of  iron,  12  parts  of  which 
combine  with  1  part  of  arsenic,  froming  an  insoluble  compound;  also  light 
magnesia,  which  will  remove  l-25th  its  weight  of  arsenic  from  its  solution 
in  water. 

Cantharides  (Spanish  Fly). — This  is  given  by  ignorant  men  for  pur- 
poses which  are  defeated;  but,  being  an  acrid,  irritant  poison,  it  produces 
serious  results,  frequently  causing  inflammation  of  the  urinary  organs. 

Symptoms:  Violent  thirst,  copious  discharge  of  bloody  mucous  from 
the  stomach,  mixed  with  which  may  be  seen  the  shiny  green  particles  of 
the  "flies;"  there  are  great  pains  in  the  loins  and  bowels,  swelling  and 
inflammation  of  the  genital  organs,  and  bloody  stools  and  urine. 

Antidotes:  An  emetic  should  at  once  be  resorted  to,  the  dog  should 
afterwards  be  drenched  with  demulcents,  and  a  dose  of  opium  given  every 
three  or  four  hours. 

Carbolic  Acid — This  produces  baneful  effects,  even  by  absorption 
through  the  pores  of  the  skin,  when  too  freely  used.  It  causes  great  pros- 
tration, with   trembling  of  the  whole  frame. 

Symptoms:  Extraordinary  depression  of  the  vital  powers,  general 
shivering  and  almost  constant  trembling  of  the  limbs,  and  a  palsied  motion 
of  the  head.     Bleeding  at  the  nose  is  a  frequent  symptom,  and  the  dis- 


 

charges   from   the  bowels  are  also   often   stained   with   blood;    the   counte- 
nance of  the  sufferer  is  expressive  of  a  most  helpless  and  painful  state. 

Antidoes:  The  proper  treatment  consists  in  placing  the  dog  in  a  warm 
bath,  using  friction  the  while,  and  administering  such  stimulants  as  am- 
monia, ether,  brandy,  etc.,  in  water  or  gruel. 

Corrosive  Sublimate  is  used  for  a  variety  of  purposes  about  farms,  al- 
though for  most  of  these  it  must  be  admitted  a  non-poisonous  article  would 
answer  as  well  or  better.  Corrosive  sublimate,  phosphorous  and  strych- 
nine each  enters  into  the  composition  of  paste  and  powders  largely  sold  for 
the  destruction  of  vermin,  and  it  is  when  so  used,  being  placed  on  bread 
and  butter,  bits  of  meat,  etc.,  that  they  are  most  likely  to  be  picked  up  by 
the  dog. 

Symptoms:  Violent  vomiting  and  purging  of  stringy  and  offensive 
matter,  the  belly  is  distended  and  painful  to  the  touch;  the  urine  suppress- 
ed, cramp  and  twitches  are  noticeable  in  the  limbs,  and  frequently  paraly- 
sis ensues. 

Antidotes:  Tartar  emetic  as  an  emetic;  white  of  egg,  followed  imme- 
diately by  infusion  of  galls;  milk  or  gluten  of  wheat.  Of  the  chemical  anti- 
dotes, the  albumen  of  eggs  is  by  far  the  best;  the  white  of  one  egg  is 
sufficient  to  neutralize  or  render  insoluble  4  gr.  of  solid  bichloride  of  mer- 
cury. 

Phosphorous. — Antidoes:  Calcined  magnesia,  with  diluents  and  de- 
mulcents given  in  quantity. 

Strichnine. — Symptoms:  Acute  pain,  causing  the  dog  to  utter  sharp 
cries;  frequent  twitchings  and  jerkings  of  the  head  and  limbs,  the  fore  and 
hind  legs  are  drawn  towards  each  other,  the  back  is  arched;  the  fits  of 
cramp  and  twitching  are  intermittent,  but  are  readily  brought  on  by  a 
touch  or  a  sudden  noise.  Foaming  at  the  mouth  is  another  and  frequent 
symptom. 

Antidotes:  Give  an  emetic  at  once,  mustard  and  hot  water,  coffee,  salt 
and  hot  water;  give  lard,  or  any  fat,  in  considerable  quantities. 

"The  following  has  saved  many  valuable  dogs  poisoned  by  strychnine 
and  will  save  any  dog  if  breath  is  Left  in  body.  As  soon  as  the  owner  is 
convinced  that  the  dog  has  strychnine,  or  dog  button  (nux  vomica),  symp- 
toms of  which  are  readily  detected  by  spasms  and  rigid  spine,  give  fifteen 
drops  of  homeopathy  tincture  of  belladonia  (green  root).  Give  same  dose 
after  each  spasm.  If  dog  is  too  far  gone  to  swallow,  inject  thirty  drops  in 
rectum.  The  second  dose  can  be  given  by  mouth.  It  is  seldom  the  third 
dose  is  necessary."  This  I  copied  from  letter  sent  to  the  American  Field 
by  some  sportsman  who  had  been  out  hunting  with  his  pointer.  He  fur- 
ther wrote:  "When  I  reached  him  he  had  had  some  twelve  spasms  and  was 
rigid,  tongue  cold,  eyes  turned,  etc.  Three  doses  brought  the  dog  out  and 
some  thirty  quail  were  killed  over  him  the  next  day." 

Here  are  also  other  antidotes  that  are  used  in  cases  of  poisoning: 

Strychnine  is  most  commonly  used  to  poison  dogs,  and  if  noticed  when 
taken  sick,  or  even  after  violent  convulsions  have  set  in,  they  can  almost 


 

Invariably  be  saved  by  injecting  under  the  skin,  with  hypodermic  syringe, 
LO  grain  doses  of  chloral  (dissolved  in  water)  every  15  or  20  minutes  until 
50  or  60  grains  are  used. 

If  convulsions  quiet  down  and  dog  seems  better,  it  might  be  safe  to  stop 
when  30  or  40  grains  have  been  given. 

It  will  pay  any  one  owning  a  number  of  dogs  to  keep  a  hypodermic 
syringe. 

Dent  says:  The  best  antidote  for  strychnine  poisoning  is  chloral  hy- 
drate, size  of  dose  depends  upon  the  condition  of  the  dog;  in  health  the 
done  is  5  to  20  grains. 

Dog  poisoning  is  so  prevalent  in  many  parts  of  the  country  just  now, 
it  may  not  be  out  of  place  to  reproduce  part  of  Mr.  A.  J.  Sewell's  (the 
noted  English  veterinarian)  article  on  this  subject  in  the  Kennel  Gazette 
(Eng.),  so  that  dog  owners  may  be  prepared  for  such  emergencies: 

"In  all  cases  of  poisoning,  more  especially  when  due  to  strychnia, 
prompt  action  is  required  and  means  should  be  at  once  taken  to  make  the 
dog  disgorge  what  has  been  swallowed.  An  emetic  that  will  act  well  and 
quickly  must  be  at  once  administered;  for  this  there  is  nothing  better  than 
a  dose  of  apomorphia.  This  medicine  acts  in  two  ways;  it  is  the  quickest 
and  surest  emetic,  and  besides  it  relieves  the  spasms.  The  dose  is  the 
eighth  of  a  grain  for  small  dogs,  and  about  the  quarter  of  a  grain  for 
the  large  ones,  given  in  a  teaspoonful  of  water;  but  the  best  way  of  admin- 
istering it  is  by  injecting  it  under  the  skin  with  a  hypodermic  syringe — 
than  from  three  to  eight  minims  of  the  one  in  fifty  s'olutions  is  to  be  given. 

"I  always  advise  persons  who  keep  a  number  of  valuable  dogs  to  have 
a  solution  of  apomorphia  by  them  ready  for  emergency,  for  while  it  is  being 
obtained  the  patient  may  die,  and  if  huntsmen  would  always  carry  a  small 
bottle  of  solution  with  them,  many  a  valuable  hound's  life  might  be  saved. 
When  this  medicine  is  not  at  hand  some  other  emetic  must  be  given.  Ordi- 
nary table  salt  can  be  always  quickly  procured,  and  from  one  teaspoonful  to 
a  tablespoonful,  according  to  the  size  of  the  dog,  should  be  given  in  warm 
water.  If  the  dose  does  not  act  freely,  repeat  it  in  a  few  minutes,  or,  instead, 
give  from  five  to  twenty  grains  of  powdered  ipecacuanha,  or  from  one  to 
three  grains  of  tar  emetic.  Either  of  these  may  be  shaken  dry  on  the 
tongue;  the  dog  must  be  made  to  vomit  somehow,  but  anything  like  salt 
requiring  a  quantity  of  water  is  often  difficult  to  administer,  as  the  dog's 
mouth  is  often  tightly  clenched  and  trying  to  open  it  induces  a  paroxysm, 
during  which  time  it  is  impossible  to  give  anything  by  the  mouth,  and  here 
the  advantage  of  the  subcutaneous  injection  of  apomorphia  comes  in.  This 
may  also  be  repeated  in  a  quarter  of  an  hour  if  the  vomiting  has  not  been 
free.  Besides  the  emetic  some  medicine  is  necessary  to  relieve  the  spasm. 
Fro  this  there  is  nothing  better  than  chloral  and  bromide  of  potassium. 
From  fifteen  grains  to  two  scruples  of  each  may  be  given  in  from  one  to 
three  tablespoonfuls  of  water  if  the  dog  can  be  made  to  swallow,  and  half 
the  quantity  of  each  may  be  given  again  in  twenty  or  thirty  minutes  and 
repeated,  if  necessary,  in  half  an  hour.  When  the  dog  is  unable  to  swal- 
low, from  three  to  ten  minims  of  nitrite  of  amyl  held  to  the  nose  on  a 
pocket  handkerchief  is  useful.  This  may  be  repeated  In  a  quarter  of  an 
hour,  or  chloroform  may  be  given.  Also  inject  into  the  rectum  from  one- 
half  to  two  drams  of  laudanum,  in  from  on  to  four  tablespoonfuls  of  water, 




which  repeat  in  a  quarter  of  an  hour,  and  again  in  another  fifteen  ininuteS 
if  the  paroxysms  continue.  After,  the  severe  symptoms  have  passed  and 
the  dog  is  weak  and  prostrate,  from  one-half  to  two  teaspoonfuls  of  brandy 
added  to  some  milk  may  be  administered  and  repeated  every  hour  for  a 

time.)' 

Ground  Glass. — The  symptoms  are  bloody  passages,  great  pain  and 
distress,  and  vomiting  of  blood.  There  is  no  cure  for  this,  and  it  is  merciful 
to  destroy  the  poor  animal  at  once,  ending  his  suffering  by  chloroforming. 

I  now  conclude  this  article  by  giving  one  that  was  published  in  the 
American  Stock-Keeper: 

"Phosphorous  is  a  dangerous  poison,  and  will  be  got  from  rat-paste 
which  is  left  lying  about,  spread  on  bread  and  butter.  For  this  give  an 
emetic,  followed  by  a  draught  of  Magnesia  and  water.  Afterwards  milk 
and  other  demulcents,  with  a  few  drops  of  laudanum  to  allay  pain.  Mer- 
cury may  be  taken  in  several  forms — either  as  Calomel,  'White  Precipi- 
tate,' or  'Corrosive  Sublimate' — all  of  which  are  accessible  to  dogs  at  var- 
ious times.  Give  large  draughts  of  white  of  egg  beaten  up  with  water;  an 
emetic  first.  Then  diet  on  milk  and  broth.  If  violent  purging,  give  a  little 
laudanum.  Sulphate  of  copper  is  in  common  use  about  farms,  and  so  is 
dangerous  to  dogs,  who  may  pick  up  and  devour  dead  birds  in  a  corn  field 
in  which  the  seed  has  been  dressed  with  this  poison.  Its  antidotes  are 
demulcents  (after  the  usual  emetic),  such  as  white  of  egg  and  milk,  and  a 
little  laudanum  later.  It  "will  be  seen  from  the  forecoming  that  the  treat- 
ment for  all  mineral  poisons  is  very  similar  all  round. 

"Now,  as  to  vegetable  poisons,  or,  to  be  more  precise,  organic  poisons 
(minerals  being  inorganic).  The  chief  of  these,  as  far  as  they  affect  dogs 
and  their  owners,  are  Aconite,  Belladonna,  Digitalis  ('Fox-glove'),  Opium 
Strychnine  and  their  various  compounds  or  derivatives.  First,  then, 
Aconite,  which  is  often  given  as  a  medicine,  and  of  which  it  is  easy 
to  give  an  overdose.  Give  an  emetic,  and  then  proceed  with  stimulants — - 
brandy,  etc.  Keep  warm,  and  try  artificial  respiration  if  need  be.  For  Bel- 
ladonna similar  treatment.  Good  hot  drinks  of  stimulants.  Foxglove 
(Digitalis)- — often  prescribed  for  heart  affections  in  dogs,  as  well  as  in  men 
- — for  this,  after  an  emetic,  give  warm  tea,  followed  by  stimulants.  Opium, 
the  active  principle  of  which  is  morphia,  needs  a  good  emetic,  followed  by 
a  draught  of  brandy  and  water;  every  effort  must  be  made  to  subdue  drow- 
siness by  brisk  exercise  until  the  effect  has  worn  off.  Lastly,  Strychnine — - 
deadliest  of  poisons — a  component  of  all  vermin  killers — easily  recognized 
by  its  effect  on  the  muscles.  Give  an  emetic,  followed  by  doses  of  Potas- 
sium Bromide  every  twenty  minutes,  and  later  a  dose  of  Castor  Oil.  Strych- 
nine is,  as  we  have  stated  earlier,  the  most  active  principle  of  Nux  Vomica." 

Here  is  also,  some  good  advice  on  strychnine  poisoning  that  I  found 
some  place,  and  worth  including: 

"Strychnine  poisoning,  unfortunately,  is  so  rapidly  fatal  that  the  dog 
is  usually  found  dead  or  dying.  If  there  has  been  immediate  vomiting  or 
only  a  small  dose  swallowed,  the  chances  of  recovery  are  good  when  the 
proper  means  are  available.  If  vomiting  has  not  occurred,  produce  it  by 
giving  a  warm  solution  of  common  salt  (a  tablespoonful  to  the  pint)  in  large 


 

doses  until  the  stomach  is  well  emptied.  After  this  the  most  important 
object  is  to  produce  stupor,  and  morphine,  hypodermically  administered,  as 
well  as  being  a  good  emetic,  is  a  safe  narcotic  in  the  dog.  In  dogs  over 
six  months  old  one-fourth  grain  can  be  given  safely  for  every  ten  pounds  of 
live  weight.  This  should  be  followed  by  chloroform  inhalation  adminis- 
tered lightly  and  kept  up  until  the  convulsions  become  less  pronounced. 
Chloral  hydrate  is  probably  the  best  antidote  in  cases  where  it  cannot  be 
given  by  the  mouth  owing  to  spasm  of  the  cheek  muscles.  It  should  be 
given  in  from  ten  to  thirty  grain  doses,  dissolved  in  an  ounce  of  warm 
water,  injected  gently  in  the  rectum.  The  dose  can  be  repeated  if  con- 
sidered necessary  every  hour.  The  animal  suould  be  kept  as  quiet  as  pos- 
sible, harsh  sounds,  bright  lights  or  unnecessary  handling  tending  to  increase 
the  severity  of  the  convulsions." 

Parasites,  External — The  number  and  variety  of  parasites  that  make 
one  part  or  another  of  the  dog  their  habitat  is  very  great.  These  are  di- 
vided into  external  and  internal;  in  the  former  two  distinct  mites,  produc- 
ing two  very  distinct  forms  of  the  mange,  have  already  been  referred  to, 
and  the  internal  parasites  are  treated  under  Worms. 

There  is  no  dog  owner  of  much  experience  who  is  not  aware  that  great 
care  and  cleanliness  are  needed  to  prevent  the  introduction  of  these  un- 
welcome visitors,  or  who  has  not  had  to  pay  smartly  for  their  extermina- 
tion, if  his  kennels  have  been  neglected.  The  parasites  to  which  I  par- 
ticularly wish  to  direct  attention  are  three  in  number — the  louse,  the  flea 
and  the  tick — which  now  follow  in  order  named  as   to  treating. 

Dog  Louse. — These  resemble  that  of  a  man,  only  larger  in  size,  and  can 
not  live  on  a  human  being.  It  causes  great  irritation,  the  dog  scratching 
and  worrying  himself  constantly.  They  live  on  all,  or  any  part  of  the 
body,  but  most  abundant  about  the  head  and  face,  the  eyes,  roots  of  ears, 
and  along  the  top  of  the  back.  By  closely  examining  the  dog's  skin,  red 
streaks  and  dots  of  blood  will  be  seen  where  the  louse  has  been  feeding. 

One  species  is  described  in  Prof.  Neumann's  "Parasites,"  translated 
by  Prof.  Fleming: 

"The  head  is  short  and  almost  as  wide  as  long;  it  is  salient  in  the 
thorax  to  which  it  is  exactly  applied;  the  third  and  fourth  articles  of  the 
antennae  are  alike.  The  abdomen  is  very  developed  in  the  female,  and  is 
a  long  oval  in  shape;  it  has  nine  rounded  segments,  which  are  often  salient 
at  the  sides;  stigmates  distinct  and  marginal;  the  first  seven  segments 
have  two  rows  of  short  bristles.  The  general  tint  is  yellowish-white,  the 
head  and  thorax  being  a  little  darker.  T^he  female  is  2mm.  long,  and  the 
male  l-15mm."  This  louse  is  oftener  found  about  the  throat  and  back  of 
the  ears,  but  extends  to  all  parts  of  the  body. 

The  other  louse  of  the  dog  is  Trichodectes  latus,  of  which  this  is 
Neumann's  description:  "The  head  is  sub-quadrangular  and  much  wider 
than  it  is  long,  being  truncated  in  front;  the  antennas  are  hairy  and  dif- 
ferent in  the  two  sexes,  the  first  article  in  the  male  being  much  thicker, 
and  occupying  a  moiety  of  the  length  of  the  organ.  The  abdomen  is  broad, 
and  more  rounded  in  the  female,  with  lateral,  but  no  median  spots.     The 


122  1)ISEASES 

color  is  bright  yellow,  spots  darker;  the  bands  on  the  head  are  blackish- 
brown.     Length  of  the  female  is  l-5mm.,  of  the  male  14mm." 

My  dog  soap  will  destroy  lice  if  thoroughly  and  well  rubbed  in,  allowed 
to  remain  on  dog  for  half  an  hour,  when  you  can  rinse  off  and  dry  the 
dog.  If  in  winter,  ^cold  or  damp  weather,  you  must  of  course  be  careful 
and  not  expose  dog  to  danger  of  catching  cold.  It  is  the  only  preparation 
in  the  way  of  a  dog  soap  that  will  kill  lice,  containing  one  ingredient  which 
is  a  secret,  that  enables  it  to  do  such  good  work  in  exterminating  the  pests 
that  dogs  are  liable  to  have,  and  yet  perfectly  harmless  to  the  dog,  even 
if  he  should  lick  it,  being  non-poisonous  as  well  as  being  excellent  for 
the  coat  and  a  great  hair  grower.  I  may  here  add  that  it  is  just  as  good 
in  every  way  for  use  on  the  owner's  head  as  it  is  for  his  dog.  In  using 
my  soap  to  rid  a  dog  of  lice,  give  dog  a  most  thorough  shampooing  with 
your  hands,  not  missing  a  spot  on  his  body  from  tip  of  nose  to  end  of 
tail.  Rub  as  close  up  to  and  around  the  eye  as  you  can  without  getting 
it  into  the  eye,  but  no  particular  harm  could  come  if  the  lather  get  in  the 
eye.  Repeat  this  application  the  same  way  twenty-four  hours  later,  this 
to  kill  the  youngsters  that  breed  every  twenty-four  hours. 

After  the  application  has  been  on  dog  for  an  hour,  you  can  then 
rinse  in  lukewarm  water  and  dry  thoroughly  with  a  rough  towel.  The 
same  care  as  to  dog  being  exposed  to  cold  air  or  draughts  must  be  exer- 
cised as  in  an  ordinary  bath.  My  soap  can  well  be  termed  a  wonderful 
discovery,  and  it  is  without  doubt  by  far  the  best  dog  soap  ever  made. 

Here  is  another  treatment  to  givo: 

"Lice,  the  presence  of  which  gives  rise  to  the  affection  sometimes 
termed  phthiriasis,  are  of  common  distribution,  as  parasites  throughout 
the  animal  kingdom.  Two  varieties  affect  the  dog,  namely,  the  Hcemato- 
pinus  Piliferus,  and  the  Trichodectes  Latus.'  The  first  of  these,  as  a  rule, 
Is  chiefly  found  about  the  head,  ears,  etc.,  but  may  wander  over  any  part 
of  the  body;  the  second  is  found  over  various  other  parts  of  the  body, 
and  appears  to  play  an  important  part  in  the  life  history  of  the  tapeworm, 
the  eggs  of  which  it  may  eat,  and  so  act  as  an  'intermediary  bearer'  of 
the  internal  parasite,  which  finds  its  way  into  the  alimentary  canal  through 
the  accidental  swallowing  by  the  dog,  of  the  external  parasite. 

"Both  species  of  parasite  are  destitute  of  wings,  yellowish  grey  or 
yellow  in  color,  and  have  their  mouths  specially  adapted  for  sucking. 
Pediculi  always  cause  more  or  less  itching,  consequently  a  tendency  to 
■cratch.  This  is  not  all,  but  in  many  cases  they  lead  to  the  formation  of 
scabs. 

"The  female  is  larger  than  the  male,  and  deposits  her  eggs,  or  nits, 
upon  the  hairs,  attaching  each  one  thereto  by  a  tough  transparent  sheath. 
The  female  lays  about  50  eggs,  wEtich  are  hatched  in  two  days. 

Treatment. — It  is  not  usually  a  very  difficult  matter  to  get  rid  of  lice. 
Thorough  cleanliness  is  essential,  with  disinfection  and  destruction  of  all 
material  with  which  the  animal  has  been  in  contact.  Sucking  pups  are 
frequently  affected,  in  which  case  the  treatment  must  be  directed  to  both 
parent  and  offspring.  After  cleansing  of  the  kennel,  destruction  of  the 
bedding  material,  etc.,  the  former  should  be  washed  with  soft  soap  and 
warm  wat«r,  afterwards  dressed  with  the  following  solution:  Stavesacre 
seads  1  ounce,  water  1  quart.     The  seed  must  be  boiled  for  about  an  hour 


 

in  Water,  and  then  adding  sufficienl  water  to  bring  if  up  to  a  quart  again. 
With  this  the  dog  should  be  thoroughly  dressed  from  head  to  tail,  taking 
care  not  to  leave  one  hair  untouched.  It  is  certain  death  to  both  parasite 
and  eggs.  After  24  hours  it  may  be  washed  off,  and,  if  necessary,  applied 
again.  The  suckling  pups  must  be  combed  before  being  given  back  to  their 
mother.  This  must  be  repeated  daily,  until  they  are  perfectly  free  from 
vermin.  They  may  also  be  dressed  with  the  same  solution,  but  it  should 
be  diluted,  five  ounces  of  camphor  being  added  to  five  ounces  of  camphor 
water.  Of  course  washing  is  here  inadmissable.  Another  remedy,  which 
is  equally  effectual,  is  a  weak  solution  of  lime  and  sulphur  lotion,  whilst 
for  animals  of  a  more  mature  age,  it  may  be  used  of  the  ordinary  strength." 

The  following  will  also  destroy  lice: 

Flour    of   sulphur    1   pound 

Unslacked   lime    y2    pound 

Water    1  gallon 

Slake  the  lime  in  the  water,  stir  in  the  sulphur,  adding  water  gradually 
until  it  is  of  a  creamy  consistence,  then  add  the  remainder  of  the  gallon 
and  boil  down  to  half  a  gallon;  let  it  stand  till  cool,  pour  off  the  clear 
liquid,  and  make  the  quantity  to  two  and  a  half  quarts  with  cold  water. 
If  the  coat  and  skin  is  thoroughly  saturated  with  this,  and  left  on  for  ten 
minutes,  the  vermin  will  all  be  dead,  when  the  dog  should  then  be  well 
washed,  using  warm  water,  and  thoroughly  combed  and  dried.  This  may 
be  too  strong  a  solution  for  delicate  toy  dogs  with  tender  skins,  and  can 
be  reduced  in  strength  by  adding  equal  parts  of  water  to  one  of  the  lotion. 
If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  this,  first  try  the  weaker  solution. 

Another  and  a  harmless  and  non-poisonous  remedy  for  lice  is  Eber- 
hart's  Skin  Cure,  which  will  do  the  work  if  wrell  rubbed  in,  never  missing 
a  spot  on  the  dog,  allowed  to  remain  in  for  half  an  hour,  and  applied  again 
twenty-four  hours  later. 

These  dressings  should  be  repeated  in  eight  days,  in  order  to  destroy 
the  young  lice  from  the  "nits"  or  eggs,  laid  before  the  previous  dressing. 

Here,  I  give  also,  a  very  good  article  on  Lice,  which  I  found  some- 
where, and  it  is  worth  including: 

"Lice  cause  great  irritation  and  will  eventually,  if  means  are  not  taken 
to  rid  the  dog  of  the  living  burden,  take  the  blood  out  of  the  dog  and  even- 
tually cause  death.  Of  course  that  is  extreme,  but  a  bunch  of  such  para- 
sites if  not  heroically  handled  will  soon  get  ahead  of  the  operator  and 
then  there  is  nothing  to  do  but  shave  the  animal  and  give  it  a  strong 
soaking  in  some  mixture  that  will  kill  the  'nits.'  Mercurial  ointment  is 
a  sure  knocker,  but  it  is  not  advisable  for  the  novice  to  use  unless  in- 
structed in  its  application  and  the  precaution  to  be  taken  that  the  dog 
does  not  lick  the  ointment  afterwards  and  thus  become  more  or  less 
poisoned.  This  is  obviated  by  muzzling  until  the  ointment  wears  off,  or 
is  washed  off. 

The  best  thing  we  have  found  is  an  emulsion  made  of  one-third  very 
hot  milk  mixed  with  two-thirds  kerosene  oil.  We  generally  mix  it  in  a 
kandy  bottle  with  a  shake  stopper  and  opening  the  coat  drop  in  the  emul- 


 

sion  which  of  course  must  be  well  shaken  while  being  applied.  The  milk 
counteracts  any  blistering  of  the  skin  that  might  arise  from  the  application 
of  the  oil  alone.  This  kills  everything  living  and  saturates  the  eggs  which 
are  the  source  of  course  of  future  trouble,  and  the  reason  some  people 
find  it  impossible  to  get  rid  of  lice  while  the  dog  lives.  This  treatment 
is  not  only  death  to  lice,  but  life  to  the  coat,  bringing  it  out  in  glossy 
profusion.  The  milk  must  be  very  hot,  but  not  boiling  or  it  will  curdle 
in  the  oil.  When  the  emulsion  has  dried  in,  it  is  well  to  wash  the  dog, 
though  this  is  not  absolutely  necessary  unless  the  odor  of  kerosene  is 
offensive. 

However  many  cures  one  may  make  the  best  one  is  prevention  and 
the  measures  to  be  adopted  will  occur  to  any  intelligent  dog  owner.  At  the 
same  time  if  it  is  a  case  of  the  home  dog  as  above,  it  is  very  difficult  to 
handle  and  unless  periodic  treatment  is  given  the  dog  the  trouble  will  get 
ahead  before  you  are  aware.  In  the  kennels  one  may  adopt  heroic 
measures  in  the  way  of  burning  partitions  and  the  like  nests,  but  in  a 
kitchen,  however  clean,  it  may  be  kept,  there  are  little  nooks  and  cracks 
that  cannot  be  so  strenuously  treated,  for  the  dog  may  lie  around  in  many 
places.  Applications  of  strong  disinfectants  like  'Standard  Disinfectant'  is 
very  good  for  this  purpose." — See  their  ad.  in  this  book. 

Naturally  dogs  that  are  kept  in  clean  auar*Qrs  and  groomed  every 
day  do  not  have  lice  unless,  as  we  hinted  above,  they  touch  some  dog  that 
has  lice  or  come  in  contact  with  some  place  where  lice  dogs  frequent.  This 
may  seem  superfluous  advice  to  the  wise  owner  of  dogs,  but  it  is  just  this 
ignorance  on  the  part  of  novice  owners  of  dogs  that  breeds  lice  and  kin- 
dred parasites,  that  start  skin  troubles  and  all  sorts  of  derangements  sauced 
by  continual  scratching  and  the  nervous  condition  in  which  a  dog  infested 
with  lice  soon  finds  itself.  The  emulsion  spoken  of  above  may  be  used 
with  safety  on  any  dog.  Should  a  pet  dog  start  any  such  trouble,  rubbing 
with  alcohol  will  usually  put  a  quietus  on  the  vermin. 

The  writer  has  just  tried,  for  the  first  time,  "Standard  Disinfectant," 
on  an  Irish  setter  that  came  back  from  a  show  with  lice  he  got  there,  and 
in  two  thorough  applications,  using  a  stiff  brush  to  apply  it,  I  cleared 
this  dog  of  the  lice.  I  put  three  ounces  "Standard  Disinfectant"  in  a  pail, 
then  added  a  gallon  of  water  to  it,  and  then  used  a  sponge  for  his  head — ■ 
then  use  a  stiff  brush  for  rest  of  his  body,  legs  and  tail,  applying  it  liberally. 
In  ten  minutes  after  I  thoroughly  dried  him  with  rough  towels.  Only  two 
applications  were  necessary  in  his  case,  as  I  did  not  miss  a  spot  on  him, 
but  sometimes  it  might  be  necessary  for  more  applications,  if  you  had 
missed  a  few  lice. 

A  special  article  from  Field  and  Fancy: 

Pleurisy — Covering  the  lungs  and  reflected  over  the  walls  of  the  chest 
is  a  very  fine,  smooth,  delicate,  glistening  membrane  known  as  the  pleura. 
This  membrane  is  moistened  by  a  fluid  that,  in  connection  with  the  smooth, 
polished  surface  of  the  membrane,  permits  of  the  easy,  frictionless  move- 
ments of  the  lungs  during  breathing.  Sometimes  as  a  result  of  wounds, 
bruises  or  injuries,  more  commonly  as  the  result  of  colds  and  occasionally 
for  no  appreciable  cause,  this  membrane  becomes  inflamed,  and  we  have  a 



most  painful  disease  known  as  pleurisy.  In  this  disease  the  lubricating 
fluid  previously  mentioned  disappears.  The  glistening  surface  of  the  mem- 
brane becomes  swollen  and  roughened,  so  that  in  breathing  the  part  of  the 
membrane  covering  the  lungs  and  the  part  reflected  over  the  walls  of  the 
chest  rub  together  and  make  breathing  a  most  painful  process.  This  stage 
lasts  about  twenty-four  hours,  and  then  the  lubricating  fluid  that  disappears 
at  the  first  sign  of  the  disease  begins  to  reappear  in  increased  quantities 
and  there  is  a  general  effusion  into  the  chest  cavity  on  the  affected  side. 
In  some  cases  this  effusion  is  so  great  as  to  almost  or  completely  fill  the 
space  formerly  occupied  by  the  lungs,  and  they  are  compressed  into  a  small 
mass  and  rendered  entirely  useless.  In  acute  attacks  of  this  disease  that 
terminate  in  recovery  there  is,  in  a  few  days,  a  reabsorption  of  this  fluid, 
and  the  pleura  regains  its  normal  condition.  If  the  reabsorption  of  the 
fluid  in  the  cavity  is  slow  or  delayed  and  extends  over  a  period  of  two  or 
three  weeks  the  patient  is  left  with  what  is  known  as  chronic  pleurisy. 

Symptoms:  In  some  cases  there  is  a  soreness  of  the  chest  for  two 
or  three  days  to  which  no  attention  has  been  paid;  in  other  cases  there  is 
a  severe  chill,  accompanied  by  shivering  and  intense  pain  in  breathing,  so 
that  the  animal  does  not  completely  fill  the  lungs,  but  takes  short,  quick, 
catchy  breaths.  There  is  a  cough  and  all  the  symptoms  of  fever,  such  as 
restlessness,  increased  thirst,  loss  of  appetite,  watery  eyes;  anxious,  wor- 
ried expression;  hot,  dry  nose  and  coated  tongue.  The  veins  of  the  eyeball 
and  lips  darken  in  color.  The  animal  lies  on  the  affected  side  so  as  to  allow 
the  opposite  lung  more  opportunity  to  expand. 

An  examination  of  the  chest  will  show  a  restrained  movement  of  the 
lungs.  The  characteristic  sounds-  in  the  first  stage,  are  a  dry,  grating,  rasp- 
ing sound  caused  by  the  inflamed  and  roughened  surfaces  of  the  pleurae 
rubbing  against  each  other.  After  effusion  of  the  liquid  has  taken  place, 
we  have  the  second  stage  of  the  disease.  This  is  easily  determined  by  per- 
cussion. Press  two  or  three  fingers  of  one  hand  flat  and  firmly  against 
the  chest  wall  and  strike  them  with  one  or  two  fingers  of  the  other  hand. 
The  blows  should  be  quick,  short  and  light.  Strike  only  once  on  each 
spot,  and  move  the  hand  quickly  from  one  spot  to  another  until  the  entire 
chest  has  been  covered.  If  this  be  done  to  both  the  well  and  affected  side, 
a  rapid  comparison  can  be  made  of  the  difference  in  sound.  If  the  sound 
given  forth  is  dead,  flat  and  woodeny,  it  denotes  an  absence  of  air  in  that 
part  of  the  chest  and  indicates  that  the  chest  cavity  is  filled  with  fluid 
and  the  lung  compressed  into  a  solid  mass.  On  auscultation  the  respiratory 
sound  is  entirely  suppressed  or  only  faintly  heard.  An  examination  of  the 
chest  of  normal  dogs  both  by  auscultation  and  percussion  will  familiarize 
the  owner  with  the  natural  sounds  so  that  he  will  have  no  difficulty  in 
recognizing  the  departures  and  variations  in  disease. 

The  pulse  in  pleurisy  is  quite  diagnostic  of  the  disease,  being  quick, 
hard,  wiry  and  much  faster  than  normal.  The  temperature  varies  from 
101  to  103. 

Prognosis:  Pleurisy,  although  a  painful  disease,  is  simple  as  com- 
pared to  pneumonia  or  bronchitis.  As  a  rule  only  one  side  is  affected,  and 
in  the  absence  of  pus,  the  disease  generally  terminates  favorably. 

Treatment:  In  diseases  of  the  chest  as  in  all  other  diseases,  diet  and 
hygienic  surroundings  are  of  the  utmost  importance.     The  object  in   the 


 

first  state  is  to  relieve  the  pain  and  suffering  and  if  possible,  to  check  the 
progress  of  the  disease.  This  is  best  accomplished  by  giving  a  dose  of 
Dover's  powder,  varying  in  size  from  five  to  thirty  grains,  depending  upon 
the  size  of  the  dog.  This  will  relieve  the  pain,  quiet  the  patient  and  thus 
limit  the  constitutional  disturbance.  The  chest  jacket,  described  in  the 
treatment  of  pneumonia,  should  then  be  applied,  as  it  is  a  great  protec- 
tion. 

If  a  dose  or  two  of  Dover's  powder  early  in  the  disease,  does  not  check 
its  course,  the  following  prescription  may  be  used: 

Morphine   Sulphates    ■ two   grains 

Tr.  Aconite  Rad twenty  drops 

Aquae three  oz. 

Ft.   Mist  Sig. 

Dose  is  one  teaspoonful,  every  four  hours,  until  the  animal  is  quiet 
and  inclined  to  sleep. 

If  the  fluid  within  the  chest  cavity  docs  not  disappear  within  a  week, 
there  is  danger  of  its  becoming  purulent.  A  veterinary  surgeon  or  physi- 
cian should  be  called  in  to  tap  the  chest,  low  down  and  far  back  and  draw 
part  of  the  fluid  with  an  asperating  needle  or  a  trochar  and  canula. 

If  the  bowels  do  not  move  freely,  they  can  be  opened  and  kept  so  by 
the  syrup  of  buckthorn  in  tablespoc-nful  doses,  repeated  as  often  as  may 
be  necessary.  If  the  animal  is  very  weak,  or  the  general  strength  seems 
to  be  impaired  by  the  use  of  these  laxatives,  they  should  be  dispensed  with. 

Keep  up  the  animal's  strength  by  feeding  raw,  lean  beef,  chopped  fine, 
raw  eggs,  milk  punch,  mutton  broths  and  anything  he  will  eat  of  a  nour- 
ishing nature.  After  the  fever  abates  and  the  crisis  has  passed,  the  emul- 
sion of  cod  liver  oil  in  tablespoon ful  doses  should  be  given  three  or  four 
times  a  day.     A  good  tonic  pill  is  prepared  as  follows:  / 

Sulphate   of  Quinine    12  grains 

Sulphate  of  Iron    12  grains 

Extract   of   Gentian    12  grains 

Powdered    Ginger     12  grains 

Diastase     3  grains 

Pepsin     2  4  grains 

Make  into  twelve  pills  and  give  one  night  and  morning. 

Pneumonia — See  Lungs,  Inflammation  of.  An  inflammation  of  the 
substance  of  the  lungs  is  generally  the  result  of  exposure  to  cold  and  damp. 
The  first  stage  of  the  disease  is  announced  with  shiverings,  followed  by 
fever.  Sometimes,  in  the  worst  cases,  it  is  accompanied  by  pleurisy,  which 
is  inflammation  of  what  is  called  the  lung-case,  and,  in  such  instances,  it 
usually  proves  fatal.  In  fact,  whether  the  pneumonia  is  or  is  hot  accom- 
panied by  pleurisy  there  is  always  some  risk  of  a  fatal  termination. 

Pneumonia  admits  of  no  delay  in  management,  but  must  be  treated 
al  once  i> v  giving  a  solution  of  acetate  of  ammonia  to  reduce  the  fever-—

castor  oil  having  first  been  given  in  a  liberal  dose.  The  dose  of  the  so- 
lution of  acetate  of  ammonia  for  a  matured  dog  (one  over  a  year  old) 
would  be  for  a  fox  terrier  or  an  English  setter,  a  teaspoonful  every  three 
or  four  hours  until  fever  is  subdued.  Larger  dogs  like  a  St.  Bernard, 
greyhound  or  a  Great  Dane,  a  teaspoon  and  a  half  could  be  given.  If 
the  malady  is  not  checked  at  this  stage,  it  quickly  passes  on  into  a  second 
stage,  when  hepatization  takes  place.  The  cough  now  is  frequent  and 
accompanied  by  expectoration,  and  respiration  is  performed  with  great 
effort  and  pain,  and  the  general  expression  is  haggard  and  pitiful  in  the 
extreme.  '  "When  it  has  reached  this  stage  a  warm  poultice  of  linseed 
meal  should  be  placed  in  the  region  of  the  lungs,  and  be  renewed  several 
times,  care  being  taken  that  after  the  first  poultice  a  piece  of  flannel  is 
bound  over  the  spot,  lest  the  patient  should  take  a  fresh  chill. 

After  the  fever  has  subsided,  tonic  treatment  will  be  necessary,  and 
for  this  there  is  nothing  better  than  quinine,  the  dose  of  which  would  be 
about  two  grains  every  three  hours  for  setters  and  pointers,  and  more  in 
proportion  for  larger  dogs.  For  toy  or  smaller  dogs  one  grain  is  enough. 
Solid  food  must  be  entirely  withheld  until  the  patient  has  quite  recovered; 
he  must  be  dieted  on  such  things  as  beef  tea,  milk,  broth,  etc.  Finally,  the 
cure  will  have  to  be  made  complete  by  a  course  of  some  good  tonic  pill, 
in  which  iron  is  one  of  the  ingredients.  Clayton's,  or  Sergeant's,  or  Dent's 
Condition  Pills  are  good  to  use  now.  I  can  furnish  either  by  return  mail 
if  you  cannot  find  them  in  your  own  town. 

Peritonitis. — See  Bowels,  Inflammation  of. 

Penis,  Discharge  from  (Balanitis).— A  great  many  dogs  suffer  from  an 
inflammation  and  excited  state  of  the  organs  of  generation,  having  frequent 
partial  erections,  with  a  discharge  of  a  thick  yellowish  matter,  very  loath- 
some if  in  a  house  dog.  Treatment  consists  in  bathing  the  parts  frequently 
with  cold  water,  giving  quite  a  strong  dose  of  ordinary  black  draught  and 
the  following  medicine: 

Bicarbonate  of  soda 2        drams 

Bicarbonate  of  potash    2        drams 

Tincture   of  henbane    3        drams 

Mindererous    spirit    1  y2    ounce 

Water    to    make    6        ounces 

Dose  for  a  toy  dog  up  to  20  lbs.  a  teaspoonful  four  or  five  times  a  day. 
Larger  dogs  a  tablespoonful.  The  prepuce  should  also  be  syringed 
with  weak  Condy's  Fluid  or  a  lotion  of  boracic  acid,  one  scruple 
to  six  ounces  of  water.  Give  the  dog  barley  water  to  drink  and 
very  little  meat.  Milk  and  broth  with  chopped  green  vegetables 
(cooked)   would  be  most  suitable  in  such  cases. 

Paralysis — Paralysis  is  due  to  pressure  or  injury  of  brain  or  to  spinal 
cord.  If  one  side  of  the  brain  is  affected,  the  opposite  side  of  the  body 
will  be  paralyzed;  but  if  the  whole  of  the  brain  is  implicated,  the  paralysis 


 

will  be  general.  When  it  arises  from  injury  to  the  spine,  it  is  the  parts 
behind  that  power  ,  that  are  affected.  Paralysis  often  follows  distemper; 
the  hindquarters  suffer;  in  severe  cases  the  dog  losing  the  use  of  his  hind 
legs,  dragging  them  along.  In  such  a  case  the  muscles  of  the  thigh  will 
soon  shrivel,  and  a  cure  is  very  rare.  Chronic  constipation  also  produces 
paralysis,  and  may  come,  as  the  result  of  general  debility  and  old  age. 
Believers  in  dumb  rabies  say  that  paralysis  of  the  lower  jaw  renders  the 
animal  incapable  of  biting.  Most  everyone  is  familiar  with  the  appearance 
of  paralysis,  the  loss  of  muscular  power  and  constant  wasting  away  of  the 
muscles  in  the  part  affected.  Paralysis  may  be  general,  but  is  in  most 
cases  confined  to  one  set  of  muscles,  ranging  from  a  slight  tottering  gait  to 
complete  loss  of  power  and  inability  to  walk.  Loss  of  power  and  wasting 
of  the  hindquarter  may  also  be  caused  by  tapeworm.  So  long  as  the  dog 
can  use  his  limbs  he  should  be  given  regular  gentle  exercise.  The  food 
must  be  nourishing  and  rather  laxative.  Oatmeal  porridge  mixed  with  a 
strong  beef  or  mutton  broth,  every  other  day,  will  generally  have  a  gentle 
action  on  the  bowels,  with  a  meal  once  a  week  of  boiled  liver,  which  will 
have  a  laxative  effect. 

If  the  disease  is  connected  with  debility  the  strength  must  be  gotten 
up  by  extra  food,  giving  more  than  usual  of  cooked  meat,  in  small  quan- 
tities but  fed  oftener  than  usual.  The  medicines  in  paralysis  are  tonics,  and 
strychnine — the  active  principle  of  nux  vomica — which  has  a  special  power 
over  the  muscles  and  nerves.  One  to  three  grains  of  powdered  nux  vomica, 
according  to  size  and  age  of  the  dog,  or  from  one-twentieth  to  of?e-six- 
teenth  of  a  grain  of  strychnine,  with  two  to  six  grains  of  extract  of  gen- 
tian, and  one  or  two  grains  of  quinine  made  into  a  pill.  Great  care  must 
be  used  in  compounding  the  pills,  containing  as  they  do  such  a  powerful 
drug  as  strychnine.  Give  a  pill  twice  a  day.  In  mild  cases  of  paralysis, 
syrup  of  the  phosphates,  with  strychnia  (called  Easten's  syrup),  is  often 
of  great  service.  In  lieu  of  the  latter  tonics,  a  handier  thing  to  do  is  to 
use  Sergeant's  Condition  Pills,  which  contain  strychnine  and  other  good 
tonic  properties.  In  paralysis  of  the  hind  legs  the  bladder  generally  par- 
ticipates, the  dog  being  unable  to  stand,  and  cannot  pass  the  urine  freely. 
Use  the  catheter  in  such  cases  night  and  morning,  or  the  dog  held  up  and 
pressure  applied  to  each  side  in  the  region  of  the  bladder  to  expel  its  con- 
tents. As  a  preventive  of  bed  sores  and  congestion  of  one  lung  turn  the 
dog  over  occasionally. 

Here  is  a  case  that  was  prescribed  for  by  Dent: 

"Please  prescribe  for  my  English  setter  dog,  eight  months  old.  Last 
November  I  hunted  him  through  the  month,  in  December  he  lost  the  use 
of  his  hindlegs,  and  in  January  seemed  to  lose  the  use"  of  all  four  legs; 
appetite  was  good  at  all  times,  eyes  were  bright,  nose  cold,  seemed  in 
perfect  health  except  in  his  legs.  I  doctored  him  a  while  for  rheumatism 
but  stopped  about  four  weeks  ago,  and  about  one  week  ago  he  seemed 
to  get  a  little  better.  Can  now  use  his  front  legs,  can  manage  to  sit  up 
and  draw  himself  around  with  a  half  limp,  the  back  legs  being  useless  now. 
Will  he  get  well  and  is  it  rheumatism  or  is  he  paralyzed?  Ans. — Give  a 
teaspoonful  of  the  syrup  of  hypophosphites  three  times  a  day,  also  give 
one-half  grain  of  nux  vomica  twice  a  day.     It  is  paralysis." 




The  following  ia  a  case  of  Partial  Paralysis,  or  congestion  of  the  spina* 
cord,  prescribed  for  by  Dent.     You  might  have  a  similar  case,  so  I  give  it: 

"My  pointer  dog,  three  years  old,  weight  forty-rive  puunds,  was  taken 
sick  last  November  in  the  field,  let  down  in  the  back,  has  since  grown  worse, 
will  now  lie  around  and  at  times  cry  from  pain;  he  will  crawl  around  on 
his  front  feet  and  drag  his  hindquarters  when  first  taken  out  of  the 
kennel,  then  will  gradually  get  up  on  his  hind  feet  and  down  on  his  fore- 
feet, walking  behind  and  crawling  in  front,  and  in  a  few  moments  will 
get  up  on  all  four  feet,  but  walks  very  stiffly  and  only  remains  up  for  a 
short  time  until  he  goes  down.  Please  name  disease  and  treatment.  Ans. 
— Give  your  dog  one-half  grain  of  nux  vomica,  five  drops  of  Fowler's  Solu- 
tion of  Arsenic  and  a  tablespoonful  of  Fellows'  Syrup  of  the  Hypophos- 
phites  of  Soda  three  times  a  day.  The  disease  is  a  partial  congestion  of 
the   spinal   cord." 

Paralysis  in  Bitches  Before  Parturition. — The  following  case  is,  I  am 
glad  to  say,  not  common.  Mr.  Caswell,  of  England,  furnishes  this  exper- 
ience, and  I  insert  it  as  he  gives  it,  as  it  may  be  beneficial  in  similar  cases, 
should  they  occur.  It  is  probable  that  the  extreme  hot  weather  con- 
tributed to  the  development  of  the  disease.  The  treatment  was  about  the 
best,  and  all  that  could  have  been  done: 

"Within  the  past  month  I  have  had  three  beagle  bitches  taken  sick 
shortly*  before  whelping,  all  exhibiting  the  same  symptoms,  viz.,  paralysis 
of  the  hindquarters  and  great  labor  in"  breathing;  for  this  I  gave  stimu- 
lants (whisky)  and  rubbed  the  loins  with  mustard,  also  continued  massage 
of  the  belly  and  loins.  In  the  first  case  labor  pains  came  on  and  the  bitch 
had  one  pup,  after  which  paralysis  set  in  again  and  the  remaining  two 
pups  were  removed  with  the  forceps  with  great  trouble.  The  bitch  died. 
Postmortem  appearances  showed  that  septicemia  had  set  in.  In  the  second 
case,  after  exactly  similar  symptoms,  massage  was  again  tried,  and  even 
though  the  bitch  seemed  very  far  gone,  she  revived.  The  best  obtainable 
veterinary  surgeon  was  in  attandance,  and  decided  to  wait  awhile  before 
performing  a  Caesarian  operation.  Stimulants  revived  the  bitch  once  more 
and  she  had  five  healthy  pups,  and  is  nursing  them  now  very  well.  The 
third  case  started  with  paralysis  and  the  bitch  revived  two  or  three  times 
under  treatment  as  before,  then  died  without  pupping.  Postmortem  re- 
vealed three  pups,  all  placed  rather  far  forward.  This  bitch  was  not 
within  two  weeks  of  whelping  time.  She  showed  normal  appearance,  was 
in  excellent  condition,  had  been  kept  in  a  large  run  and  given  exercise 
daily,  as  were  the  others. 

"This  is  the  first  time  I  have  seen  this  paralysis  in  ten  years  of 
breeding.  The  last  two  bitches  had  reared  litters  all  right  before.  Can  you 
tell  me  the  cause,  as  the  veterinarians  about  me  seem  unable  to  do  so?  Also 
if  the  extremely  hot  weather  has  had  anytihng  to  do  with  it." 

Piles. — This  occurs  -more  frequently  in  house  dogs  or  those  confined 
too  closely  to  their  kennel,  being  an  enlarged  condition  of  the  hemorrhoidal 
veini  at  the  lower  part  of  the  rectum,  presenting  an  enlarged,  swollen  and 
Under  appearance,  which  gives  pain  when  touched,  ©r  when  the  dog  drags

himself  along  the  ground.  Piles  are  internal  and  external,  .as  they  exist 
within  or  without  the  muscle  that  contacts  the  orifice  of  the  anus.  The 
disease  is  readily  ascertained  as  the  condition  of  the  parts  are  naturally 
small,  firm  and  contracted.  Piles  are  produced  by  over-feeding  with  too 
much  stimulating  food,  want  of  sufficient  and  healthful  exercise,  produc- 
ing diseases  of  the  liver,  constipation  of  the  bowels,  consequent  straining  and 
undue  distension  of  the  parts  in  the  act  of  fecation.  The  diet  in  a  cure 
of  piles  should  be  laxatives,  very  little  meat,  but  a  portion  of  boiled  liver 
may  be  allowed  with  broth  or  in  soups,  oatmeal  well  boiled  and  vegetables. 
As  a  mild  aperient  a  little  milk  of  sulphur  shoud  be  given  in  milk  or  with 
the  food.  Dose  would  be  a  heaped  up  teaspoonful  for  a  dog  of  20  lbs., 
larger  and  smaller  in  proportion.  Here  are  some  ointments,  either  of  which 
can  be  used: 

Ointments  for  Piles. — Mild  mersurial  ointment,  7  parts,  finely  powder- 
ed camphor,  1  part,  well  mixed;  or  the  compound  gall  ointment  of  the 
Pharmacopoeia  may  be  used.  Hazeline  is  also   very  beneficial. 

In  bleeding  piles  the  following  injection  may  be  used:  Tincture  of  kra- 
meria,  2  drams,  water  to  6  ounces.  Two  ounces  should  be  injected  twice 
a  day;  while  in  all  cases  of  Piles  Va  dram  to  2  drams  of  tincture  of 
krameria  in  water,  twice  a  day,  will  be  useful. 

In  some  cases  of  piles  a  tumor  forms  near  the  orific  of  the  rectum;  it  is 
at  first  red,  but  afterward  becomes  purple,  and  finally  discharges  a  thick 
fetid  matter  with  blood.  It  forms  a  ragged  sore,  difficult  to  heal  from 
movements  of  the  dog  in  the  natural  act,  and  from  dragging  himself  along 
the  ground.  Similar  treatment  to  that  already  advised  should  be  given, 
using  the  ointment  and  washing  with  the  following  lotion  alternately. 

Wash  for  Tumor j — Goulard's  water,  %  pint;  laudanum,  %  ounce; 
tincture  of  arnica,    %    ounce;   mixed. 

Periostitis  (Inflammation  of  the  Periostem,  the  Membrane  Covering  of 
the  Bone,  is  not  often  met  with  in  the  dog,  usually  arising  from  direct  in- 
pries.  It  is  a  most  painful  disease,  the  membrane  becomes  greatly  inflam- 
ed and  swollen,  separated  from  the  bone,  while  frequently  deposits  of  bone 
the  result,  which  cause  lumps  that  are  unsightly.  The  symptoms  are  heat 
and  swelling  of  the  skin  over  the  affected  parts,  great  pain  upon  manipu- 
lation, feverishness  and  lameness  when  it  occurs  in  a  limb.  Quiet  is  very 
essential.  Apply  hot  flannels  to  the  part,  or  in  severe  cases,  hot  linseed 
poultices  will  be  better.  If  lumps  remain  after  the  swelling  has  left  the 
part,  then  paint  these  with  tincture  of  iodine,  discontinuing  this  when  the 
skin  becomes  sore.  I  prefer  to  apply  Iodin  Vasigin,  full  strength,  as  it  does 
not  make  the  skin  sore,  and  can  be  rubbed  in  with  the  hand,  twice  daily. 

Parturient  Apoplexy. — See  Milk  Fever. 

Pleurisy — See  Inflammation  of  Lungs. 

Pharyngitis  (Inflammation  of  the  Pharynx) — This  disease  frequently 
affeats  dogs.  True  pharyngitis  is  usually  due  to  soma  foreign  body  lodg«d 
in  the  pharynx,  although  it  has  been  caused  by  strong  drugs  given  with 


 

the  object  of  curing  disease.  In  such  cases  the  stomach  suffers  also.  Symp- 
toms are  a  dry,  irritating  cough  and  a  difficulty  in  swallowing  is  observed 
later  on,  the  dog  showing  pain  in  swallowing;  a  contraction  of  the  muscles 
of  the  throat  shown,  and  upon  manipulation  the  pain  is  plainly  shown. 
Upon  opening  the  mouth  and  examining  the  throat  it  will  be  found  red  and 
swollen,  and  unless  the  inflammation  is  checked  ulceration  of  the  throat 
will  follow  quickly;  or  abscesses  form,  which  will  cause  a  discharge  through 
the  nostrils.  v      t.  ,—_,.   ^t\m\^ 

Treatment. — Ascertain  the  cause  and  try  to  remove  it.  If  condition  is 
clue  to  foreign  matter,  this  must  be  moved,  and  with  hot  linseed  poultice 
(kept  in  position  by  a  bandage)  applied  to  the  neck.  Nothing  solid  must  be 
given  to  eat,  feed  milk,  eggs  or  Bovine.  This  simple  treatment  will  gen- 
erally effect  a  cure,  but  should  ulceration  occur,  then  paint  the  part  with 
a  weak  solution  of  nitrate  of  silver — 2  grains  of  this  to  V2  ounce  of 
distilled  water — night  and  morning  with  a  camel's  hair  brush.  If  ulcera- 
tion is  severe  and  granulations  present,  touch  the  latter  with  "London 
Paste,"  best  applied  on  the  point  of  a  probe,  around  which  is  rolled  a 
piece  of  wool.  If  pharyngeal  abscesses  form  they  must  be  lanced  to  empty 
contents.  The  dog  will  be  left  in  a  debilitated  state  when  the  acute  symp- 
toms have  subsided,  due  to  the  general  constitutional  disturbance  accom- 
panying the  disease.  A  tonic  should  now  be  given.  Clayton's  or  Dent's 
Condition  Pills  will  be  just  the  thing  to  use  for  a  while. 

Polypus. — A  tumor  growing  on  some  mucous  membrane,  the  nose,  or 
the  vaginal  passage  being  attacked  by  a  stalk  or  pedicle,  varying  in  length 
and  thickness.  The  tumor  is  smooth,  of  a  red  color,  shaped  like  a  pear 
and  when  small  is  concealed  from  view,  but  protrudes  as  it  grows.  It 
discharges  a  mucus  matter  often  tinged  with  blood  and  generally  offen- 
sive in  smell. 

The  treatment  is  simple,  consisting  in  the  removal  of  the  polypus  by 
tieing  a  white  silk  thread  or  piece  of  fine  silver  wire  around  the  neck. 
Tighten  this  daily  for  a  few  days,  until  the  neck  is  cut  through  and  the 
tumor  drops  off.  Then  bathe  the  parts  freely  with  Goulard  Water.  If 
fever  exists,  a  dose  of  cooling  medicine  will  suffice,  but  this  is  rarely  ever 
necessary. 

Prolapsus  Ani. — This  sometimes  occurs  in  pampered  house  dogs  that 
are  old  and  too  fat,  and  from  insufficient  exercise  which  produces  constipa- 
tion and  causes  straining.  The  protruding  part  should  be  cleansed,  pressed 
back  into  place,  and  cold  douches  used  frequently.  Diet  should  be  laxative 
and  exercise  must  be  given.  If  the  prolapsis  recurs,  a  stitch  of  two  can  be 
inserted.     The  diet  must  then  consist  entirely  of  milk. 

Prolapsus,  or  Falling,  of  the  Vagina  is  characterized  by  a  soft,  red 
swelling,  and  generally  occurs  during,  or  immediately  after  the  period  of 
heat.  It  must  be  carefully  washed  with  lukewarm  water  and  gently  re- 
turned to  its  place.  The  following  injection  should  then  be  used  for  a  few 
days,  and  one  of  the  powders  given  twice  a  day. 

Injections  for  Prolapsus. — Tannic  acid  and  glycerine,  1  ounce;  water  to

mak«  a  pint.  Or  tincture  of  krameria,  2  drams;  water  to  make  6  ounces. 
Two  ounces  to  be  injected  night  and  morning  with  a  female  syringe. 

Astringent  Powders  for  Prolapsus. — Take  gallic  acid  18  grains;  alum, 
12  grains;  mix,  and  divide  into  six  equal  powders,  and  give  one  twice  a  day, 
first  dissolving  them  in  hot  water,  but  allowing  them  to  cool  before  ad- 
ministration. This  dose  will  do  for  an  ordinary  sized  dog  from  a  setter 
up  to  a  St.  Bernard.  Toy  dogs  like  a  pug  and  smaller  ones,  give  half 
powder. 

Falling  of  the  vagina  must  not  be  confounded  with  inversion  of  the 
womb,  which  occasionally  happens  after  pupping,  and  which  can  only  be 
safely  treated  by  a  qualified  veterinarian. 

Pulse.— See  Temperature  and  Pulse. 

Purging — Thig  is  a  symptom  in  many  diseases,  but  it  may  exist  simply 
from  temporary  derangement  of  the  stomach,  or  from  some  irritating  sub- 
stance taken  into  the  intestines,  in  which  cases  a  dose  of  castor  oil  and  extra 
attention  to  diet  are  all  that  is  necessary. 

Polypi.— Tumors  growing  on  some  mucous  membrane,  the  nose,  ear, 
anus  or  vaginal  passage,  the  latter  most  common.  They  are  attached  by 
a  stack  or  pedicle  varying  in  length  or  thickness,  red  in  color,  smooth  and 
pear-shaped.  They  vary  in  size;  when  small  are  concealed  from  view,  but 
protrude  as  they  grow.  A  mucous  matter,  tinged  with  blood  and  offensive 
in  smell  is  sometimes  discharged. 

Treatment  consists  in  their  removal  by  tying  a  strong  white  silk  thread 
tightly  around  the  neck  of  the  polypi  till  the  neck  is  cut  through  and  the 
tumor  drops  off.  They  can  also  be  removed  by  an  ecraseur,  an  instrument 
made  for  this  purpose.  Bath*  the  parts  frtely  for  a  few  days  with  Goulard 
Water. 

Rheumatism — (This  article  was  written  especially  for  this  book  by 
"Dent." — This  disease  may  affect  either  th«  joints,  In  which  casss  the  bones 
are  often  affected,  or  the  muscles  themselves.  What  is  known  as  Lumbago, 
in  which  the  back  and  hindquarters  are  affected,  and  the  dog  shows  evi- 
dences of  the  most  intense  pain,  being  barely  able  to  move,  and  drags  his 
hind  legs,  is  only  a  form  of  rheumatism. 

The  same  can  be  said  of  those  common  diseases  popularly  referred  to 
as  kennel  lameness,  or  chest-founder,  in  which  the  muscles  connecting  the 
shoulder  blade  to  the  chest  are  affected,  and  the  animal  is  very  stiff  and 
sore  In  front,  particularly  noticeable  when  running  down  hill. 

The  cause  of  rheumatism  is  a  poisonous  acid  in  the  blood,  and  this 
acid  is  produced  and  induced  by  a  bad  diet,  exposure  to  cold  winds,  damp- 
ness, eeneral  neglect  and  exposures. 

Svmntoms. — Pa;n,  stiffness,  soreness,  disordered  stomach,  difficulty  in 
movlnar.  more  or  less  fever,  anxiety,  and  in  some  cases — swelling  of  the  joint. 
Tn^i  (lire-iso  piqo  sh*ft3  from  one  location  to  another,  or  may  disappear  for 
a  day  to  reappear  the  next  with   increased  severity. 

Treatment. — Give   the  ftnlmal   warm,   comfortable   Quarters,   and   la 


 

most  eases  a  warm  bath  will  give  relief,  using  care  to  see  that  the  animal  is 
carefully  and  thoroughly  dried  after  bath.  If  it  is  still  in  great  pain  give 
a  dose  of  Dover's  Powders,  and  if  necessary,  open  the  bowels  with  one 
dose  of  the  following: 

Class  1. —  (Adult  dogs,  5  to  12  lbs.) — Olive  oil,  one  teaspoonful;  cascara 
sagrada,  fluid  ext.,  3  to  10  drops. 

Class  2. —  (Adult  dogs,  12  to  20  lbs.)— Olive  oil,  one  tablespoonful; 
cascara  sagrada,  fluid  ext.,   10   to  15  drops. 

Class  3. —  (Adult  dogs,  20  to  40  lbs.) — Olive  oil,  one  ounce;  cascara 
sagrada,  fluid  ext.,  15  to  30  drops. 

Class  4. —  (Adult  dogs,  40  lbs.  and  over.) — Olive  oil,  one  or  two  ounces; 
cascara  sagrada,  fluid  ext.,  30  to  60  drops. 

The  above  doses  are  for  a  purgative  action.  As  a  gentle  laxative  give 
one-half  the  above  doses  morning  and  evening.  Puppies,  two  months  old, 
of  Classes  2,  3  and  4,  take  half  dose  of  Class  No.  1,  and  for  puppies  three 
to  six  months  old  give  them  as  a  dose  half  of  Class  No.  2. 

These  two  drugs  are  both  so  gentle  and  harmless  that  no  danger  fol- 
lows their  use.  A  pup  six  months  old  can  take  nearly  as  much  medicine  as 
an  adult,  while,  for  instance,  a  two  month  old  fox  terrier  will  take  nearly 
as  much  at  a  dose  as  would  a  mastiff  or  Great  Dane  of  same  age. 

After  having  given  above,  now. treat  patient  with  following  three  times 
a  day: 

Class  1.- — (Adult  dogs,  10  to  20  lbs.) — Salicylate  of  sodium,  3  grains; 
quinine,  1  grain;  plienacetin,  1  grain. 

Class  2.— (Adult  dogs,  20  to  40  lbs.)— Salicylate' of  sodium,  10  grains; 
quinine,  2  grains;   plienacetin.  3  grains. 

Class  3. —  (Adult  dogs.  40  up  to  150  lbs.) — Salicylate  of  sodium,  15 
grains;   quinine,   3  grains;  phenacetin,  '5  grains. 

Not  generally  used  for  pups  under  five  months,  but  from  five  up  to 
ten  month- pups  use  one-half  above  doses;  over  ten  months,  dogs  of  breeds 
of  first  two  classes  take  an  adult  dose. 

In  some  cases  it  is  advisable  to  use  a  liniment.  The  best  one  for  this 
purpose  is  a  combination  of  compound  camphor  liniment,  four  ounces;  and 
aconite  liniment,  two  ounces.  Rub  it  well  into  the  affected  parts  for  at 
least  half  an  hour,  then  wipe  dry  and  muzzel  the  an'mal  for  a  while,  to 
prevent  his  licking  himself,  as  this  liniment  is  a  powerful  poison.  If  the 
joints  are  very  severely  affected,  after  applying  the  liniment,  wrap  them 
up  in  cotton  wool. 

Feed  light,  easily  digested  foods;  vegetable  soups  with  boiled  rice, 
oatmeal    or   corn   mush. 

Here  are  a  couple  of  cases  that  were  prescribed  for:  "I  have  a  dog,  four 
years  old,  that  seems  to  be  affected  in  a  peculiar  manner.  He  seems  stiff 
all  over  his  body.  On  the  slightest  exertion  he  shows  great  pain,  and  by 
simply  touching  him  it  seems  to  make  him  howl,  and  cry  dreadfullv.  He 
has  been  showine  this  now  for  a  month  or  six  week?  "-A  -1-"'*  ^eem  to  be 
improving.  Sometimes  when  he  ents  it  is  almost  impo--'1  le  for  him  to 
move  his  head  up  or  down.  I  should  be  pleased  to  hear  from  you.  An*  — 
Yonr  dog  has  muscular  rheumatism,  and  I  would  suggest  the  following 
treatment:  Gire  interally  tincture  coleMmm  'n  15  dron  doses  three  times 
dally.     There  tare  been  »  number  of  anti-rheumatic  agents  recommended 


  """* 

for  affections  of  this  kind,  but  so  far  some  of  them  have  not  proved  to  he 
of  much  benefit.  Also,  in  connection  with  the  above  treatment  it  would 
be  well  to  use  some  stimulating  embrocation,  rubbing  into  the  skin  thor- 
oughly with  a  woolen  cloth.  This  should  be  used  once  daily.  Spirits  of  cam- 
phor might  be  tried,  or  the  aconite  and  camphor  liniment  prescribed  by 
Dent — the  poisonous  one." 

"Please  prescribe  for  a  dog,  one  hundred  and  fifty  pounds  weight,  that 
has  a  bad  case  of  rheumatism  in  the  stifle  joint,  the  third  attack  in  the  same 
joint.  He  has  had  it  now  for  several  weeks  and  is  just  beginning  to  walk 
on  that  leg  very  stiffly;  cannot  put  it  down  when  running.  I  am  afraid 
Ihe  joint  will  be  permanently  stiffened.  Advise  me  as  to  treatment,  exer- 
cise  and  feeding.  Ans. — Give  ten  grains  of  the.  salicylate  of  soda  and  two 
grains  of  quinine  three  times  a  day,  hand  rub  the  joint  gently  three  times 
a  clay  twenty  minutes  at  a  time;  feed  milk  and  stale  bread  and  a  very 
little  meat;  keep  in  warm  quarters  and  do  not  expose  to  the  weather;  give 
walking  exercise  on  pleasant  days  only." 

Ribs,  Fracture  of. — This  injury,  which  is  not  uncommon  in  dogs,  is 
usually  due  to  a  kick.  The  symptoms  are  pain  on  manipulating  the  part, 
the  breathing  is  short,  the  ribs  are  more  or  less  fixed,  and  crepitus  can 
be  heard  if  the  ear  is  applied  to  the  ribs.  The  ribs  should  be  bandaged 
rather  tightly,  to  prevent  undue  expansion  of  the  chest  walls,  and  this  will 
generally  effect  a  cure,  if,  however,  the  lungs  are  injured,  then  such  com- 
plications as  pneumonia  or  pleurisy  may  arise.  A  mild  aperient  is  always 
beneficial. 

Ringworm. — Dogs  occasionally  have  this,  due  to  a  vegetable  parasite. 
It  is  a  round,  scaly  patch,  very  contagious,  and  also  due  to  dirty,  damp 
kennels,  but  could  be  communicated  to  the  dog  from  a  child  who  was  playing 
with  it.  The  best  treatment  is  a  little  of  the  ointment  of  iodide  of  iron, 
well  rubbed  in  twice  a  day,  prepared  as  follows:  1  dram  of  iodide  of  iron 
to  7  drams  of  spermaceti  ointment;  mix.  My  Skin  Cure  will  also  cure 
this  trouble.  Another  remedy  is  yellow  oxide  of  mercury,  15  grains,  and 
benzoated  lard,  1  ounce.  Another  is  oleate  of  copper,  one  part  to  lard  four 
parts,  which  will  cure  it  up. 

Rickets. — Dalziel  says  of  Rickets: 

"Pups,  the  offspring  of  an  enfeebled  clam  yielding  an  insufficient 
supply  of  milk,  and  that  of  poor  quality,  or  those  that  are,  from  any  cause, 
ill  fed  and  neglected  or  kept  in  close,  ill-ventilated  places,  without  a  chance 
of  fresh  air  and  needful  exercise,  suffer  from  mis-shapen  limbs,  thick  joints 
and  other  deformities,  caused  by  the  bones  being  imperfectly  developed, 
the  food,  and  other  conditions  on  which  the  pup  is  reared,  not  yielding 
the  constituents  necessary  to  give  them  the  required  hardness  to  enable 
them  to  perform  their  proper  functions.  This  state  is  known  as  rickets, 
and  the  cause  being  plain,  the  treatment  is  evident.  Continuous  in-and-in 
breeding  is  one  cause  of  rickets. 

"Do  not  attempt  to  rear  a  pup  on  a  weakly,  unhealthy  mother,  but  if 
tbe  breed  Is  desired,  procure  for  the  pups  a  fostor-motner  of  undoubted 




health  and  stamina;  let  the  nest  be  in  a  warm,  airy  place,  and  as  soon 
as  the  pups  are  able  to  leave  the  nest  let  them  have  plenty  of  room,  fresh 
air,  warmth,  and  sunshine,  if  possible,  and  insure  thorough  cleanliness 
of  the  place  in  which  they  are  kept.  When  old  enough  to  eat,  let  their  diet 
bo  light,  nourishing  and  digestible,  and  rickets  will  be  avoided.  In  cases 
where  rickets  already  exist  attend  to  the  above  suggestions;  let  a  con- 
.  siderable  portion  of  the  diet  consist  of  good  milk,  to  which  add  a  little 
lime  water,  say  a  tablespoonful  to  every  quarter  pint,  and  give  in  the  food 
small  doses  of  cod  liver  oil  twice  a  day  for  some  months." 

The  following  is  from  "Notes  for  Novices,"  published  in  the  American 
Stockkeeper: 

"A  great  deal  has  been  said  and  written  on  the  subject  of  rickets  in 
puppies.  In  a  great  many  cases  the  trouble  is  brought  on  by  allowing 
them  to  play  and  roll  about  at  an  early  age  on  a  brick  floor.  If  it  is 
r.fressary  to  keep  puppies  in  a  house  with  brick  floor  it  should  be  covered 
©ver  with  movable  boards,  under  which  is  a  layer  of  disinfected  sawdust, 
so  a^   to  prevent  the  propagation   of  insects. 

"As  an  internal  remedy  for  puppies  which  are  rickety,  nothing  is  much 
better  than  Parrish's  Chemical  Food,  which  contains  iron  and  other  phos- 
phates and  must  improve  the  state  of  the  bone  system.  Cod  liver  oil  emul- 
sion with  hypophosphites  is  also  excellent,  and  alternate  doses  of  each 
may  be  given  with  benefit. 

"The  use  of  liniments  depend  on  circumstances.  If  the  leg  weakness  is 
caused  by  the  puppy  having  been  kept  on  a  brick  floor,  as  suggested,  it  is 
possible  to  put  matters  all  right  again  by  the  use  of  liniment  only.  But 
if  due  to  phvsical  weakness,  less  Will  depend  upon  external  application 
than  upon  internal  remedies  given,  and  general  dieting  and  management. 
As  a  good  all-round  liniment  there  is  nothing  better  than  ordinary  hartshorn 
and  oil  liniment,  with  a  liberal  allowance  of  turpentine." 

Dent  prescribes  as   follows: 

"What  is  the  matter  with  my  St.  Bernard  puppy,  six  months  old?  H« 
walks  like  a  person  would  with  rheumatism;  it  all  seems  to  be  in  his 
forelegs;  he  followed  my  buggy  one  day  and  got  very  warm,  and  then  got 
very  wet.  He  is  quite  large  and  fleshy,  weight  one  hundred  and  ten  pounds? 
Ans. — Rickets;  give  him  a  dessertspoonful  of  precipitated  phosphate  of  lime 
in  his  food  three  times  a  day!  also  feed  him  four  ounces  of  lean  beef 
daily,  and  egg  shells  finely  broken  up  and  mixed  in  with  his  soft  food." 

The  following  was  published  in  Field  and  Fancy,  in  reply  to  request 
from  a  subscriber — written  by  Dr.  O.  V.  Brumley,  Professor  of  Canine 
Diseases  of  the  College  of  Veterinary  Department,  State  University  of  Ohio: 

"What  is  the  cause  of  rickets?  I  have  two  puppies  that  have  rickets 
now,  are  quite  valuable  ones,  and  would  like  to  save  them  if  possible.  They 
first  commenced  to  show  evidences  of  the  disease  about  two  months  ago, 
and  now  one  of  them  has  peculiar  enlargements  around  the  joints  on  the 
front  limbs,  also  on  its  face,  which  gives  it  a  very  peculiar  appearance.  The 
other  one  is  not  quite  so  bad  yet,  but  seems  to  be  getting  worse  all  the 
time.      Could  you  suggest  anything  that  would  help  them? 

"There  has  been  a  great  many  theories  advanced  in  regard  to  the 
cause  of  this  disease,  and  in  many  instances  they  do  not  seem  to  be  en- 




tirely  satisfactory.  Among  the  many  things  that  have  been  mentioned  an 
the  cause  of  rhachitis,  the  following  will  suffice  at  this  time:  A  deficiency  of 
lime-salts  as  a  consequence  of  disturbances  of  digestion;  excessive  forma- 
tion of  carbonic  acid  or  lactic  acid,  which  would  dissolve  the  lime-salts;  an 
alteration  of  the  general  nutritive  condition  on  account  of  abnormal  influ- 
ences in  young  animals;  enlargement  and  an  increase  in  the  number  and 
size  of  blood  vessels  in  the  bone  tissues,  so  that  the  lime-salts  continue  to 
circulate  in  the  blood  instead  of  being  deposited  in  the  bones.  It  might 
be  well  to  mention  that  at  the  present  time  the  exact  cause  of  this  disease 
is  not  known,  but  we  do  know,  however,  that  rickets  can  be  developed  in 
the  dog  by  deficient,  improper  food,  by  want  of  nitrogenous  food,  and  espe- 
cially bones,  as  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  animals  with  this  disease  if 
given  these  articles  of  diet  seem  to  improve  in-  a  short  time.  This  disease 
generally  makes  its  appearance  in  young  animals  in  the  first  few  months 
of  their  lives,  and  for  this  reason  also  it  is  very  often  spoken  of  as  heredi- 
tary. The  disease  seems  to  develop  relatively  in  proportion  to  their  growth; 
if  the  animal  grows  quickly,  the  disease  will  appear  quicKly,  if  growth  is 
slow,   the  disease  will  come  on  gradually. 

SPECIAL.  EXPERIMENTAL  TO  PROVE  THE  MENDELIAN  LAWS. 


In  calling  the  attention  of  our  readers  to  the  advertisement  of  the 
STERLING  COLLIE  KENNELS  we  do  so  with  special  pleasure  because  of 
the  personal  knowledge  that  we  have  of  the  kennel  and  owner.  The 
STERLING  COLLIE  KENNELS  has  been  in  existence  for  the  past  six  years 
and  has  held  a  pronent  place  in  the  breeding  and  exhibiting  of  collies  in 
this  country.  Just  now  this  kennel  doing  some  special  experimental  breed- 
ing work,  endeavoring  to  prove  the  Mendelian  laws  of  heridity  on  their 
collies,  with  the  result  that  dogs  of  a  fixed  type  and  color  are  being  pro- 
duced with  a  degree  of  certainty  that  we  have  not  heard  of  before  and  much 
good  is  being  done  for  the  breed.  Get  in  touch  with  this  kennel  If  you  are 
interested  in  collies. 

"This  disease  is  a  peculiar  disturbance  of  the  bones  of  the  whole 
System,  and  seems  to  be  a  deficiency  of  lime-salts  in  the  bones,  making 
them  solft  and  flexible.  The  bones  become  soft  enough  so  that  they  can 
be  cut  easily  with  a  knife,  and  the  ends  of  the  bones  become  much  thick- 
ened, which  accounts  for  the  peculiar  enlargements  mentioned  abor«. 
It  is  very  often  that  the  enlargements  make  their  appearance  on  the  bones 
of  the  face,  which  gives  the  animal  that  peculiar  expression.  Deformed 
and  distorted  bones  are  very  frequent  occurrences  in  this  disease,  especially 
noticeable  in  the  limbs,  which  no  doubt  comes  from  the  weight  of  the 
animal  at  the  time  the  bones  are  soft.  The  disease  as  a  rule  is  chronic,  and  it 
takes  a  long  course  of  treatment  to  bring  them  to  a  normal  condition 
again,  and  very  often  the  treatment  is  not  satisfactory.  I  have  in  mind  a 
case  now  that  entirely  recovered  from  the  disease,  but  it  was  a  mild  one,  and 
was  treated  before  the  bones  were  much  deformed.  If  the  disease  is  taken 
early,  it  may  be  checked  by  means  of  proper  feding;  but  when  the  de- 
formity is  once  formed,  it  is  only  in  extremely  rare  cases  that  it  does  not

STERLING  IN  NAME  AND  QUALITY 


SCIENTIFIC    BREEDING 

In  breeding  animals,  practically 
any  desired  result  can  be  obtain- 
ed if  the  facts  and  factors  in- 
volved, are  known.  I  am  breed- 
ing collies  scientifically — to  get 
them  true  to  type,  color  and  mark- 
ings. In  my  effort  to  solve  the 
problem  of  color  inheritance  I  am 
using  white,  sable,  blue  and  tri- 
color collies.  You  can  help  by 
sending  me  reports  of  the  off- 
spring of  registered  matings  in- 
volving their  use. 


 

show   as    the   animal    grows    to    an    adult   age.      It   very    frequently    leaves 
them   'bowlegged,'   or  with   twisted  limbs. 

"I  would  suggest  that  you  feed  plenty  of  nitrogenous  food,  such  as 
meat,  and  encourage  digestion  as  much  as  possible.  Give  bones,  and  per- 
haps it  would  be  well  to  give  small  amount  of  lime  water  to  drink.  In  the 
medicinal  treatment  use  syrups  calci  locto-phosphatis,  in  thirty  drop 
doses,  once  daily." 

Septicemia  Puerperalis,  and  Inflammation  of  the  Uterus. — "This  is 
common  in  bitches,  and  is  the  result  of  retention  and  putrefaction  of  a 
dead  fetus  (pup,)  or  the  introduction  of  putrid  matter  through  the  blood 
stream.  The  symptoms  are  high  fever,  the  nose  and  mouth  are  hot,  the 
pulse  is  quick,  the  respirations  are  increased,  the  eyes  are  injected,  the  ex- 
tremities become  cold,  and  often  insensibility  and  death  occur. 

"If  the  treatment  is  to  be  of  any  avail  it  must  be  adopted  at  once. 
First,  remove  the  cause,  if  possible,  inject  the  uterus  with  warm,  weak 
Gondy's  Fluid,  and  give  immediately  10  grains  to  20  grains  of  the  hypo- 
sulphite of  soda,  in  water  three  times  a  day.  Creasote  given  in  1  grain  to 
3  grain  doses  (made  into  a  pill  with  a  crumb  of  bread),  three  times  a 
day  is  useful;  salicylate  of  soda  is  also  recommended  in  10  grains  to  0 
grains  doses,  in  water,  three  times  a  day.  The  bowels  must  be  relaxed  by 
means  of  doses  of  oil,  and  soap  and  water  enemas.  The  kennel  must  be 
thoroughly  cleansed  and  sanitary,  the  drains  well  flushed  and  a  good  clean 
bed  provided.  The  patient  must  have  warmth  with  plenty  of  fresh  air.  The 
food  must  be  light,  such  as  beef  tea  and  mutton  broth,  with  crumbled  stale 
bread.  As  the  animal  approaches  convalescence,  1  grain  to  2  grains  of 
sulphate  of  quinine  may  be  given  with  advantage." 

The  above  is  Dalziel's  treatment.  In  lieu  of  the  quinine  during  con- 
valescence I  would  use  Clayton's,  Sergeant's  or  Dent's  Condition  Pills. 

Sarcoptie  Mange. — See   Mange. 

Scalds — See  Burns. 

Scurf,  or  Crusty  Ears — This  comes  from  want  of  attention  to  the  skin, 
but  often  appears  on  the  ears  as  a  forerunner  of  canker,  in  which  case  wash 
with  warm  water  and  anoint  with  olive  oil.  Give  the  dog  a  dose  of  physic, 
and  feed  on  a  light  diet  for  a  few  days.  If  you  will  put  my  Skin  Cure 
on  these  crusty  ears  twice  a  day,  rub  on  well  both  sides,  which  softens  up 
the  crusty  and  scaly  edges  and  flaps  of  the  ear.  then  gently  scrape  off  what  is 
loosened,  with  your  fingers — in  a  few  days  the  ears  will  be  cured.  This 
is  my  treatment,  and  it  always  works.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  my 
Skin  Cure,  containing  nine  ingredients,  carefully  blended  and  mixed,  will 
just  about  take  proper  care  of  any  skin  trouble  that  a  dog  has.  Each 
eight  ounce  bottle  is  mixed  and  prepared,  just  the  one  at  a  time,  this 
be-ng  necessary  in  order  to  get  the  different  ingredients  properly  blended, 
and  connot  be  made  in  bulk.  It.  sells  for  the  same  price  as  any  other  skin 
remedy  but.  with  all  due  regard  to  the  virtues  of  Glover's,  Gent's,  Clay- 
ton's and  Spratt's — which  are  all  good—mine  is  just  simply  better.     I've 


 

used  all  the  others,  and  they  do  the  work,  if  used  as  per  directions,  but 
— I  like  my  own  the  best.  The  price  is  Fifty  Cents  for  full  eight  ounce 
bottle,  and  can  only  go  by  express. 

Salivation  is  caused  by  administration  of  overdoses  of  medicines  in 
which  mercury  figures.  Mercurial  salts  are  in  many  skin  remedies — a  great 
mistake — as  the  mercury  will  absorb  through  the  skin.  Symptoms  of  mer- 
curial poisoning  are  increased  salivation,  gums  swollen  and  spongy,  that 
bleed  at  the  slightest  touch,  surrounded  with  a  bluish  rim,  external  fetid 
breath,  loose  teeth,  furred  tongue,  intense  thirst,  ulceration,  loss  of  oppe- 
tite,  and  sloughing  off  of  the  gums.  If  the  dog  has  had  a  large  dose,  or 
frequent  doses  have  accumulated  in  the  system,  the  stomach  and  intestines 
have  become  involved,  causing  obstinate  vomiting  and  dysentery;  the 
dog  loses  flesh  rapidly,  eruptions  occur,  the  hair  drops  off,  teeth  fall  out, 
and  aparlysis  and  death  the  result.  Symptoms  must  be  treated  as  they 
occur,  kidneys  and  bowels  operated  upon,  while  the  patient's  strength  must 
be  kept  up  by  stimulants  and  food,  in  serious  cases  you  must  force  food 
into  them — beef  tea  is  a  good  thing  and  most  eisily  given — a  little  at  a 
tiine,  but  quite  often. 

Surfiet. — See  Blotch  and   Eczema. 

Scrofula. — Dogs  have  this  disease,  but  fortunately  not  very  often.  It 
happens  oftener  in  young  dogs,  being  inherited,  or  due  to  in-breeding. 
Symptoms  are  a  general  unhealthy  and  unthrifty  condition,  the  coat  having  a 
rough,  dull  look  and  an  offensive  odor.  The  lymphatic  glands  swell,  eyes 
have  a  chronic,  whitish  discharge,  appetite  irregular,  and  the  dog's  health 
is  hardly  two  days  alike.  The  symptoms  become  chronic  as  the  dog  grow* 
older,  and  the  abdomen  pendulous.  No  dog  having  scrofula  should  ever  bo 
used  for  breeding. 

Although  scrofula  can  not  be  cured,  to  keep  it  in  check,  strict  clean- 
liness should  be  observed,  both  as  regards  the  dog  itself  and  its  habitation. 
The  animal  should  be  groomed  daily,  as  this  tends  to  produce  a  healthier 
action  of  the  skin,  have  plenty  of  exercise  and  fresh  air,  and  be  frequently 
washed  with  Eberhart's  Dog  Soap,  and  Clayton's  Blood  Pills  be  used  for 
a  course  of  treatment,  they  working  on  and  purifying  the  blood 

Scrotal  Irritation, — This  is  met  with  in  dogs  used  constantly  for  stud 
purposes.  The  scrotum  becomes  red,  spots  appear,  discharging  serum  and 
irritation  is  severe.  The  part  finally  becomes  swollen,  very  sore,  the  dis- 
charge drying  forms  scabs,  wh.ch  come  off,  leaving  sore  patches,  and  gran- 
ulation is  very  likely  to  appear.  On  the  first  appearance  of  any  irritation 
bathe  parts  with  warm  water  and  administer  a  mild  aperient.  After  you 
have  well  dried  the  parts,  dress  morning  and  night  with  boracic  ointment, 
and  put  muzzle  on  dog  to  prevent  his  licking  it  off.  If  granulations  exist 
touch  with  nitrate  of  silver.  If  the  trouble  recurs,  as  it  often  does,  repeat 
the  treatment. 

St.  Vitus  Dance. — See  Chorea. 


 

Sprains. — By  this  you  will  understand,  as  meant,  a  sudden,  violent 
straining  of  a  tendon,  or  ligament,  caused  by  extreme  or  long-continued 
exertion,  stepping  on  something,  or  by  getting  his  foot  into  &  hole  while  run- 
ning, causing  a  twist  of  limb  or  body  from  the  natural  position.  Sudden 
and  severe  pain  is  followed  by  inflammation.  You  can  discover  the  exact 
seat  of  the  injury  by  passing  the  hand  over  the  back,  shoulder,  or  limb 
which  seems  to  be  affected.  '  Rest  is  necessary  and  advisable  in  such  cases, 
and  also  to  give  a  cooling  aperient,  such  as  the  "Mild  Purgative." 

Syrup   of   buckthorn    3   parts 

Syrup  of  white  poppies    1   part 

Castor  oil    -    &   parts 

Dose  for   15   lb.   to   20   lb.   dog   is  a   tablespoonful;    larger  dogs   two 
tablespoonfuls  as  a  dose.     Shake  bottle  well 

As  soon  as  possible  bathe  with  water  as  warm  as  the  dog  can  bear 
it,  and  then  rub  the  part  with  Liniment  for  Sprains,  Bruises,  etc.,  at  least 
three  times  a  day. 

Stomach,  Inflammation  of  (Gastritis) — This  comes  from  a  number  of 
causes;  irritants  accidentally  swallowed,  sometimes  by  mineral  or  other 
poisons  carelessly  thrown  out  by  those  who  have  used  them  for  poisoning 
rats.  The  use  of  areca  nut  of  turpentine  will  cause  inflammation.  The 
dog  may  have  accidentally  swallowed  something  of  an  irritating  nature  while 
helping  himself  from  the  garbage  barrel,  as  many  clogs  will  do. 

The  Symptoms  are  excessive  thirst  and  violent  vomiting,  and  between 
these  the  dog  will  lie  on  his  side,  stretched  out,  whining  and  moaning  from 
the  pain  he  is  suffering.  When  this  is  observed  administer  from  Vi  grain 
to   V2  grain  of  hydrochlorate  of  cocaine. 

Treatment. — Keep  the  dog  undisturbed,  with  a  constant  supply  of  water 
that  has  been  boiled,  within  reach,  and  give  him  mutton  broth  made  with 
barley  and  a  little  isinglass  added  to  it.  To  allay  the  pain  a  very  little 
opium  may  be  given.  Less  medicine  in  such  a  case  is  the  better  plan  to 
follow.  If  diarrhea  should  follow,  which  is  very  likely,  this  must  be  treated 
as  directed  under  that  head. 

Sunstroke. — This  sometimes  happens  to  dogs,  the  same  as  to  people, 
but  not  often,  and  generally  not  to  a  dog  rightly  cared  for  by  its  owner, 
but  to  the  unfortunate  ones  who  have  no  owner,  the  poor  fellows  you  so 
often  see — homeless  and  friendless — on  the  streets,  many  such  I  see,  and 
while  they  lack  pedigree,  yet  they  are  dogs,  and  should  find  some  one 
who  would  be  good  enough  to  give  them  a  home,  which  all  dogs  deserve. 
I  have  now  in  my  kennel  one  dog — which  I  call  "Tramp" — that  I  found, 
and  while  he  has  no  pedigree  and  I  could  not  even  tell  you  what  breed 
he  is,  yet  "Tramp"  shows  me  every  day  by  his  actions,  his  intelligence,  and 
his  so  plainly  show  of  affection  for  me — that,  while  he  is  not  worth  ten 
cents,  yet  he  will  find  a  good  home,  and  just  as  good  treatment  as  the 
finest  bulldog  or  pug  that  I  own,  and  just  as  long  as  he  lives,  unless  I  can 
find  someone  to  whom  I  can  give  him,  and  who  will  treat  and  care  for  him 
as  he  deserves.     If  you,  my  reader,  as  you  will — run  across  a  homeless  dog 


 

— give  him  a  home,  even  if  you  could  not  tell  what  breed  he  is.  He  or  she 
would  fully  repay  you  for  this  kind  act,  and  the  Good  Master  above  will 
reward  you  for  it.  Every  dog  you  see  or  meet  deserves  all  of  this.  My 
finally  dragging  his  hind  legs.  When  placed  upon  their  legs  they  drop 
motto  is,  "You  can't  do  too  much  for  a  dog."  I  have  wandered  from  my 
subject — Sunstroke.  Treat  it  as  you  would  a  person.  Remove  the  dog 
quickly  to  some  retired  place,  as  cool  as  possible,  where  he  can  get  plenty 
of  air,  and  apply  ice  to  the  head.  If  ice  is  not  obtainable,  cold  water 
plentifully  applied  is  the  next  best  thing  to  do.     Also  give  a  little  whisky. 

Spinal  Meningitis. — The  cause  of  this  disease  may  be  traced  to  injur- 
ies to  the  spine,  violent  blows,  shocks,  falls  from  windows,  etc. 

Occasionally  we  see  this  symptom  in  distemper. 

The  symptoms  appear  slowly  or  quickly,  according  to  the  irritation 
present.  If  the  spinal  cord  is  much  involved  by  the  exudation,  we  find 
complete  paralysis,   posterior  to   that  portion   of  the  spine  affected. 

Symptoms. — The  patient  is  heavy  and  dull,  with  a  staggering  gait, 
sideways  on  their  hind  quarters.  If  the  paralysis  is  complete,  we  must  look 
for  the  injury  in  the  cervical  region  (or  region  of  the  neck).  If  a  pin  be 
used  to  the  paralyzed  members  there  is  usually  no  sensitiveness.  Coldness 
is  another  symptom.  There  is  often  complete  paralysis  or  loss  of  power 
to  control  the  urine,  and  there  is  a  difficulty  in  the  passage  of  faecal 
matter.     The  paralyzed  members  become  atrophied  from  want  of  use. 

Consciousness  is  not  at  all  impaired,  and  the  appetite  remains  fairly 
good. 

The  prognosis  is  usually  unfavorable,  and  when  recovery  does  take 
place  it  is  very  slow. 

Treatment  consists  in  counter-irritation  to  the  spine  as  biniodide  of 
mercury  or  mustard  oil,  and  strychnine  in  increasing  doses,  commencing 
with  1-50  grain  three  times  a  day,  increased  gradually  to  1-30.  Iodide  of 
potash  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  strychnine.  Electricity  may 
be  tried. 

Temperature  and  PuLse — As  indications  of  health  or  departure  from 
the  normal  state  the  temperature  and  the  moisture  or  dryness  of  the  nose 
— the  integument  forming  the  walls  of  the  nostrils — are  very  delicate  indi- 
cators, but,  if  I  may  say  so,  they  tell  too  much,  and  are  too  general,  and 
do  not  enable  us  to  discriminate.  When  the  nose  is  dry  and  hot  we  know 
the  dog  is  out  of  sorts,  but  we  have  to  search  for  other  symptoms  to  deter- 
mine what  is  the  matter.  The  pulse  and  general  temperature  are  impor- 
tant aids  to  diagnosis  far  too  much  neglected.     Dalziel  says: 

"The  first  thing  a  medical  man  does  when  he  visits  a  patient  is  to  feel 
the  pulse,  and  if  there  is  a  suspicion  of  fever  of  any  kind,  the  temperature 
of  the  body  is  carefully  taken;  this  course,  if  followed  with  the  dog,  would 
assist  the  owner  in  treating  his  animal  in  all  inflammatory  and  febril  cases, 
such  as  distemper. 

"A  dog's  pulse  varies  from  90  to  100  beats  per  minute,  the  heart's 
action  being  quicker  in  highly  bred,  nervous  dogs,  as,  for  instance,  setters, 
pointers  and  bulldogs,  and  some  finely  bred  toys.     The  owner  should,  for 




this  reason,  become  familiar  with  the  temperature  of  his  dog  in  health 
so  that  he  may  be  able  to  at  once  detect  a  departure  from  the  normal 
state.  You  can  feel  the  pulse  inside  the  knee,  but  in  small  doga  It  ia 
better  to  count  the  heart  beats.  If  you  hold  the  left  fore-leg  up,  with 
elbow  slightly  bent,  the  point  of  it  will  indicate  the  place  where  the  hand 
should  be  held  flat  over  it. 

"The  temperature  is  gauged  by  inserting  an  ordinary  clinical  ther- 
mometer in  the  rectum  for  half  a  minute,  or  in  the  mouth  between  the 
lip  and  teeth,  although  the  latter  can  only  be  done  on  a  quiet  subject.  The 
temperature  of  the  dog  normally  varies  from  100  degrees  to  101  Fahren- 
heit. 

Tetanus. — See  Lockjaw. 

Testicles,  Enlarged. — When  this  occurs,  acute  pain  Is  in  most  casea 
present,  while  in  other  cases  it  seems  to  cause  but  little  if  any  inconven- 
ience. Dogs  past  the  middle  age  are  usually  the  subjects,  and  obesity  pre- 
disposes this  condition.  Dogs  which  have  not  been  allowed  to  be  bred  are 
also  so  affected,  but  it  occurs  quite  often  in  stud  dogs  as  well,  also  due  to 
injuries.  In  treating  such  cases  try  to  remove  the  cause  if  you  can  so 
ascertain.  If  pain  is  present,  hot  fomentations  should  be  applied  and  an 
aperient  given. 

Thorns These  are  most  liable  to  pierce  the  pads  of  the  foot  (the  aole). 

The  thorn  should  be  abstracted  at  once,  and  if  a  severe  case  of  inflamma- 
tion has  been  caused  bathe  or  poultice  the  foot.

Teeth. — The  following  article  on  teeth  could  not  be  made  plainer  than 
by  what  Dalziel  says: 

"The  dog  has,  when  the  set  is  complete,  or  in  kennel  parlance,  when 
he  'has  a  full  mouth,'  forty-two  teeth,  made  up  of  twelve  inciaora,  or  cut- 
ting teeth,  four  canines  or  fangs,  and  twenty-six  molars,  double,  or  grind- 
ing teeth. 

"Some  of  these  constitute  what  are  ordinarily  called  the  milk  teeth, 
and  are  deciduous;  that  is  to  say,  they  are  after  a  few  niontha  cast,  and 
give  place  to  permanent  ones. 

"The  Incisors — six  above  and  six  below — form  the  front  teeth;  those 
In  the  upper  jaw  are  the  larger,  and  both  above  and  below  the  center  teeth 
are  the  smaller,  the  outer  or  corner  cutters  the  strongest;  these  appear 
at  the  age  of  from  four  to  five  weeks,  and  give  place  to  the  permanent  In- 
cisors at  three  to  four  months. 

"The  Canines  or  Fangs  also  make  their  appearance  when  the  pup  is 
from  four  to  six  weeks  old,  and  these  are  replaced  by  the  permanent  fangs 




about  the  age  of  five  or  six  months;  they  are  considerably  elongated  and 
pointed;   the  upper  ones  are  the  stronger. 

"The  Molars. — Of  these,  twelve  are  in  the  upper  jaw  and  fourteen  in 
the  lower;  the  first  (that  is,  of  course,  the  four,  two  upper  and  two  under) 
are  not  deciduous,  and  make  their  appearance  at  about  three  or  four  months; 
the  second,  third  in  the  upper,  and  fourth  in  the  lower,  are,  like  the  in- 
cisors and  canines,  deciduous,  appearing  at  the  fourth  or  fifth  week,  and 
giving  place  to  the  permanent  ones  at  five  to  six  months;  the  fourth  in  the 
upper  jaw  is  much  the  strongest,  and  ,in  the  lower  jaw,  the  fifth  is  the 
largest  and  strongest.  The  fifth  generally  appears  from  the  fourth  to  the 
fifth  month,  and  in  the  lower  jaw  the  fifth  is  the  largest  and  strongest.  The 
sixth  at  the  age  of  from  five  to  six  months,  and  the  seventh  in  the  lower  jaw 
from  five  and  a  half  to  seven  months.  Most  of  the  molars,  in  the  lower  jaw 
from  five  and  a  half  to  seven  months.  Most  of  the  molars,  whilst  adapted 
for  grinding  or  crushing  bones,  etc.,  are  terminated  by  acute  lobes  suitable 
for  tearing  flesh. 

"Tartar  Accumulation  Upon  the  Teeth. — This  term  is  applied  to  those 
blackish  incrustations  so  commonly  found  adhering  around  the  necks  of  the 
teeth.  It  is  by  far  the  commonest  in  pet  dogs,  or  those  which  are  chiefly 
fed  upon  soft  food.  Sometimes  the  accumulation  of  matter  is  so  great  that 
it  causes  the  teeth  to  become  loose,  leads  to  ulceration  of  the  gums,  and 
the  production  of  a  most  offensive  smell  from  the  mouth,  all  of  which  can 
be  obviated  by  giving  the  animal  an  occasional  bone  to  pick.  The  treatment 
must  be  directed  to  the  removal  of  the  tartar  deposit.  This  can  be  done  by 
putting  on  a  simple  tape  muzzle  and  then  scraping  the  teeth  with  a  small 
instrument  which  is  sold  by  most  cutlers  for  the  purpose  of  scraping  the 
nails  of  the  human  subject.  It  is  a  somewhat  tedious  operation,  neverless 
extremely  simple. 

"Care  must  be  taken  to  prevent  the  gums  from  injury,  as  they  are  very 
soft,  and  bleed  upon  the  slightest  touch,  in.  many  cases.  All  loose  and 
decayed  teeth  should  be  pulled  out,  and  the  mouth  washed  occasionally  for 
several  days  with  some  cleansing  fluid,  such  as: 

Potash    alum     Vz    dram 

Borax Vz    dram 

Permanganate  of  potash 16        grains 

Water    4        ounces 

Directons. — Apply  to  the  teeth  with  a  brush. 

"The  dog  must  have  an  occasional  aperient,  i.  e.,  a  laxative  of  a  mild 
kind,  and  there  is  nothing  better  than  half  to  one  teaspoonful  of  liquid 
extract  of  cascara  bark  in  a  little  water. 

"Broken  Teeth. — The  teeth  are"  liable  to  injury  from  various  causes, 
such  as  result  from  biting  hard  substances,  like  stone,  etc.  Unless  they 
cause  inconvenience  through  sharp  projecting  points  lacerating  the  tongue, 
etc.,  or  imperfect  mastication  of  food,  they  are  best  left  alone.  In  old  dogs 
the  teeth  are  sometimes  worn  almost  away,  and  such  it  is  advisable  to  feed 
on  soft  food. 

"Displaced   Teeth, — The   permanent   teeth   may   be     displaced      either 


 

through  a  temporary  tooth  not  having  been  shed,  or  by  an  excessive  ac- 
cumulation of  tartar.  If  caused  by  the  former,  this  should  be  extracted; 
the  latter  should  be  scaled  off  according  to  the  method  already  recom- 
mended.    Tooth  forceps  can  be  had  at  surgical  instrument  makers. 

"Caries,  or  Diseased  Teeth. — The  fangs  are  those  teeth  which  are  com' 
monly  affected.  One  or  more  of  the  teeth  appear  brown,  with  a  black  center, 
perhaps  coated  with  tartar,  and  loose.  The  breath  is  very  offensive,  and 
saliva  is  constantly  dribbling  from  the  mouth;  sometimes  swellings  under 
the  jaw.  The  sooner  the  decayed  tooth,  or  teeth,  is  removed,  the  better, 
followed  by  a  gentle  laxative,  and  Vxe  adoption  of  such  methods  as  will 
keep  the  system  in  good  working  order — viz.,  careful  dietary. 

"Abscess  of  the  Jaw. — A  decayed  tooth  may  give  rise  to  the  formation 
of  matter  below  the  jaw,  in  which  case  there  appears  a  soft  sort  of  tumor, 
swelling.     If  this  is  neglected,  a  fistulous  ulcer  may  remain. 

"In  some  cases  the  jaw-bone  itself  may  become  involved  in  the  dis- 
easer  state,  but  fortunately  this  is  rare.  The  gums  are  red,  swollen  and 
spongy.     The  breath  is  very  fetid  and  offensive. 

"The  term,  'canker  of  the  mouth,'  has  been,  and  still  is,  applied  to  this 
and  other  diseases  of  the  mouth. 

"The  treatment  consists  of  removing  the  diseased  tooth,  fomenting  the 
abscess  below  the  jaw  with  hot  water,  and,  when  ripe,  either  opening  it  with 
a  sharp  knife,  lancet,  or  allowing  it  to  burst  itself.  After  the  matter  has 
escaped,  it  should,  along  with  the  mouth,  be  washed  out  with  chloride  of 
zinc,  or  lead  lotion,  four  grains  to  every  ounce  of  water.  The  system  will 
require  good  support,  and,  it  may  be,  a  course  of  tonics,  such  as  a  grain  or 
two  of  quinine,  night  and  morning,  in  the  form  of  a  pill;  or,  using  one  of 
the  Condition  Pills  you  see  advertised  in  this  book — Clayton's,  Dent's,  or 
Sergeant's — they  are  all  good,  made  by  dogmen  for  dogs,  and  you  won't  go 
amiss  in  using  either  of  them  in  such  cases. 

"Teeth,  Decayed. — It  is  unfortunately  only  too  true  that  the  condition 
of  a  dog's  teeth  does  not  receive  the  attention  that  it  should;  this  is  very 
evident  when  it  is  borne  in  mind  that  one  of  the  most  important  functions 
of  the  teeth  is  mastication,  and  that  an  animal  cannot  maintain  good  health 
if  it  is  imperfectly  performed.  Upon  sound  teeth  greatly  depends  perfect 
mastication.  Before  assimilation  of  the  food  can  take  place  in  the  stomach 
it  must  be  received  into  that  organ  in  a  fit  condition  for  the  process,  and 
this  depends  upon  the  condition  of  the  teeth.  When  the  food  is  not  prop- 
erly chewed,  it  acts  as  an  irritant  to  the  stomach  and  bowels,  causing  indi- 
gestion and  diarrhea,  which  latter  in  puppies  often  proves  fatal. 

"Generally  speaking,  the  teeth  do  not  receive  any  attention  until  they 
decay,  and  cause  pain  or  stomach  trouble.  Preventative  measures  are  in 
my  experience  seldom  taken,  though  it  is  quite  as  necessary  for  a  dog  to 
have  clean  teeth  as  it  is  for  ourselves. 

"The  teeth  especially  require  attention  in  the  case  of  dogs  which  are 
fed  upon  an  unsuitable  diet,  as  they  become  furred,  and  finally  accumtila- 
tions  of  tartar  exist.  To  avoid  this  they  should  be  gone  over  once  a  day 
with  an  ordinary  toothbrush,  dipped  into  weak  Condy's  Fluid.  This-  will  not 
only  prevent  decay,  but  also  keeps  the  breath  sweet,  a  most  important  mat- 
ter where  the  dog  is  one's  constant  companion.  Fetid  breath,  however,  is 
not  always  due  to  the  teeth,  but  to  indigestion  as  a  result  of  their  condi- 


 

tion;  at  times,  too,  especially  when  the  teeth  are  irregular,  food  accumu- 
lates between  them!  this  should  be  removed  with  the  brush.  That  dogs  are 
frequently  the  subject  of  toothache  cannot  be  doubted,  and  is  clearly  shown 
by  the  swelling  of  the  cheek,  and  often  by  the  formation  of  abscesses.  All 
decayed  teeth  that  are  past  preserving  should  be  extracted  by  a  competent 
person." 

Turnside. — The  dog  has  no  fit  in  this  disease,  but  walks  about  appar- 
ently without  an-  object,  generally  in  circles  and  always  in  one  direction. 
Youatt  ascribes  the  disease  to  the  presence  of  hytadids  in  the  brain,  but 
results  of  more  recent  study  of  animal  parasites  are  opposed  to  this  view. 
Worms  in  the  stomach  or  intestines  is  more  likely  to  be  the  cause.  Give 
the  dog  a  few  doses  of  Sure  Shot,  Glover's,  Dent's  or  Clayton's  Vermifugs. 
Also  put  the  dog  in  a  room  or  small  kennel  yard  where  he  can  not  injure 
himself  by  running  against  things,  as  he  might,  due  to  his  sight  being  im- 
paired. 

"Tumors. — These  are  divided  into  groups  of  varying  structure — Fi- 
brous, Fatty,  Calcareous,  Melanotic,  Osseous  and  Lacteal. 

"Fibrous  Tumors  are  usually  situated  in  the  jaw  or  limbs,  they  have  a 
firm  attachment  and  are  hard  and  insensible  to  the  touch.  Excision  is  ne- 
cessary. In  the  centre  of  these  tumors  a  cyst,  or  cavity,  containing  serum 
or  matter  (pus),  often  exists,  and  in  consequence  abscesses  form  upon 
their  surface. 

"Fatty  Tumors  are  commonly  met  with  in  the  dog,  and  have  no  particu- 
lar position,  but  occur  at  any  part  of  the  body.  They  are  smooth  and  shiny 
upon  their  surface,  unattached  to  the  surrounding  tissues,  they  seldom  be- 
come inflamed,  and  are  not  tender  when  touched.  The  treatment  is  by 
excision. 

"Calcareous  Tumors. — These  are  common  in  bitches,  and  are  usually 
situated  in  the  mammary  glands.  The  treatment  is  by  excision,  external 
applications  being  of  no  avail. 

"Melanotic  Tumors  are  seldom  seen  in  canine  practice.  There  are  a 
few  cases  on  record,  and  with  them  excision  has  been  successful. 

"Osseous  Tumors  are  likewise  rare  in  dogs,  and  when  occurring,  are 
invariably  associated  with  rickets;  their  situation  is  the  limbs. 

"Lacteal  Tumors  have  already  been  fully  dealt  with  under  that  head- 
ing." 

Tongue,  Inflammation  of  (Glossitis). — Dogs  are  extremely  liable  to 
Injuries  of  the  tongue,  which  is  not  surprising  when  we  consider  the  variety 
of  articles  they  pick  up — sharp  pieces  of  bone  or  stone.  In  some  instances 
the  inflammation  is  due  to  a  sting  (I  have  known  one  or  two  cases  of  this 
in  terriers,  while  the  teeth  sometimes  cause  lacerations. 

The  symptoms  are  first  an  increase  of  saliva,  the  jaws  are  moved  con- 
stantly, and  upon  examination  the  tongue  is  found  to  be  inflamed  and  ten- 
der, swallowing  is  performed  with  difficulty,  thirst  is  present,  or  at  least 
the  animal  finds  relief  in  continually  lapping,  although  probably  not  much 
!p  swallowed.     The  mouth  should  be  rinsed  out  frequently  throughout  the 




day  with  a  solution  of  boracic  acid  (1  scr.  of  the  acid  to  G  oz.  of  water). 
To  do  this,  hold  the  head  down  slightly,  pour  the  liquid  in  one  side,  and 
allow  it  to  run  out  of  the  other.  If  a  little  is  swallowed,  it  is  of  no  con- 
sequence. A  weak  solution  of  Condy's  Fluid  can  also  be  used  in  the  same 
way  with  marked  benefit.  This  treatment,  with  an  aperient,  is  usually  all 
that  is  necessary.  If  the  inflammation  is  due  to  injuries  caused  by  the 
teeth,  the  latter  must  have  attention;  they  may  require  extraction.  The 
food  must  consist  for  a  time  of  warm  milk  or  gravy.  Chicken  gravy  or 
made  from  giblets,  with  flour  added,  is  very  nourishing,  and  many  dogs 
that  are  sick  will  eat  this  when  refusing  everything  else.  Egg  and  milk  to 
lap  may  also  suit  them,  and  it  is  good. 

Tongue,  Paralysis  of. — Occasionally  seen  in  dogs,  and  often  congenital. 
The  tongue  protrudes,  becomes  dry  and  often  cracks.  The  dog  experiences 
little  inconvenience  and  laps  with  ease.  If  cracks  appear  on  the  tongue, 
apply  a  little  boracic  acid  ointment,  which  is  non-poisonous,  while  a  little 
sweet  oil  on  the  tongue  will  prevent  the  dryness.  A  nerve  tonic  should  be 
given,  5  to  20  drops,  as  per  sized  dog,  of  the  tincture  of  Nux  Vomica,  with 
Vz  grain  to  1  grain  of  quinine,  is  a  very  good  thing  to  use  now,  given  in 
water  twice  daily  after  food. 

Tongue,  Ulcers  on  the. — A  very  painful  condition,  usually  the  result  of 
neglect,  the  teeth  having  been  allowed  to  accumulate  tartar.  The  ulcers 
may  be  quite  rough  on  decayed  teeth,  or  to  a  disordered  stomach,  this  fre- 
quently the  cause.  In  this  case  give  an  aperient,  give  a  plain  diet,  and  in 
moderate  quantities,  and  when  the  condition  of  the  stomach  improves,  the 
ulcers  disappear.  Remove  the  tartar  by  scaling,  and  rub  the  teeth  after- 
wards with  a  tooth  brush  dipped  into  a  weak  solution  of  Condy's  Fuid. 
Extract  the  decayed  teeth  if  any.  Touch  the  ulcers  lightly  with  nitrate 
of  silver. 

Ticks  resemble  in  appearance  a  spider,  to  which,  in  fact,  they  are  re- 
lated, varying  in  size  from  a  pin's  head  to  a  small  pea.  The  tick  "fastens 
in  the  skin  by  means  of  its  legs, holding  on  with  as  much  tenacity  as  fre- 
quently to  part  in  two  in  the  attempt  to  remove  it.  They  are  less  common 
and  less  known  than  either  the  flea  or  louse.  The  color  of  the  smaller  ones 
is  a  light  grey,  but  become  dark  when  gorged  with  blood  from  the  dog. 
My  Skin  Cure  will  also  destroy  these  pests,  but  you  must  rub  it  in  well 
to  kill  them,  and  all  over  the  body.  In  using  it,  after  leaving  on  the  dog 
for  fifteen  minutes,  you  can  then  rinse  off  and  dry  the  dog,  thus  getting 
rid  of  the  greasy  condition  of  the  coat.  Ticks  occasionally  occur  even  in 
the  best  regulated  kennels,  as  it  is,  of  course,  impossible  to  prevent  a  dog 
sometimes  coming  in  contact  with  other  dogs  so  infected.  Once  ticks  make 
their  appearance  lose  no  time  in  ridding  the  dog  of  them. 

Warts  are  rather  common  on  the  dog,  occurring  on  the  lips,  ears,  in- 
side of  the  mouth,  and  appear  singly  or  in  clusters.  They  can  be  removed 
by  a  ligature  tied  tightly  around  the  root  as  close  to  the  skin  as  possible. 
Another  method  is  by  ft  scalpel,  the  blade  held  fiat  on  the  skin  at  the  root 





of  the  wart — cut  through — the  raw  surface  being  then  cauterized.  "The 
hot  iron  or  actual  cautery,  although  for  the  time  the  most  painful,  is  after 
all  (says  Dalziel)  the  best  and  safest."  Neither  potasse  fusse,  nitric  acid,  or 
nitrate  of  silver  can  be  safely  used,  because  the  dog's  tongue  would  surely 
sweep  the  injured  lip,  the  consequence  being  the  caustic  in  part  would  be 
transferred  to  the  tongue,  which  would  peel  as  the  result.  If 'used,  the  jaws 
must  be  so  tightly  bound  that  the  teeth  are  held  together,  so  the  tongue 
cannot  protrude. 

The  warts  often  grow  in  clusters,  and  the  difficulty  of  dealing  with 
them  then  is  greatly  increased.  An  application  of  bicarbonate  of  soda  has 
proved  effectual  in  some  cases.

Worming;  the  Tongue. — A  silly  idea  that  may  still  exist  in  some  isolated 
nook  or  muddled  brain,  that  a  dog  has  a  worm  under  its  tongue,  the  re- 
moval of  which  is  called  "worming,!'  and  which  is  supposed  by  idiots  to  do 
great  good,  such  as  to  prevent  the  dog  from  biting,  should  he  ever  become 
mad?  Operation  consisted  in  cutting  the  bridle  of  the  tongue  and  pulling 
out  a  small  ligament,  which  contracts  and  curls  up  like  a  worm.  Anyone 
so  ignorant  should  have  the  same  operation  performed  on  their  own  tongue, 
to  see  how  cruel,  ridiculous  and  uncalled  for  is  such  an  idea.  Equally  as 
silly  is  a  similar  operation  as  to  removing  a  worm  from  the  tail  of  a  dog.

Wrenched  Back — Some  months  ago  a  party  wrote  me:  "My  dog  has 
wrenched  his  back  (by  jumping  off  a  high  table),  about  six  inches  from 
his  tail,  and  it  hurts  him  to  walk  up  the  steps.  He  gives  sharp  cries  of  pain 
quite  often  and  holds  his  hindquarters  on  a  droop." 

I  advised  as  follows,  and  the  dog  was  cured:  "Take  three  ordinary  cof- 
fee cups  of  water,  add  one  coffee  cup  each  of  strong  vinegar  and  salt. 
Heat  to  as  hot  as  you  can  just  stand  your  hand  in,  then  take  red  flannel 
cloth,  dip  in  this,  wring  out  and  lay  over  parts,  repeating  as  cloth  gets  cold, 
keeping  this  up  for  three  hours.  As  dog  gets  better  and  pain  leaves,  then 
use  a  soap  liniment  or  a  chloroform  liniment  that  your  druggist  can  fur- 
nish." 

Worms — All  dogs  are  born  with  worms;  some  few  get  through  without 
treatment,  like  some  children  do,  but  every  puppy  I  have  ever  bred  was 
treated  for  worms  at  from  six  to  eight  weeks  old,  or  as  soon  as  they  were 
weaned,  and  this  is  the  only  safe  and  sure  plan  to  follow,  for  you  make  no 
mistake  by  so  doing.  Worms  are,  without  doubt,  the  cause  of  the  death  of 
more  puppies,  in  various  ways,  than  from  all  other  diseases  combined,  de- 
stroying life  when  their  presence  is  not  suspected.  Except  in  rare  cases, 
they  do  not  do  much  damage  until  after  puppy  is  weaned,  when  they  get 
their  work  in,  and  I  hardly  ever  treat  for  worms  under  six,  and  generally 
not  until  they  are  eight  weeks  old,  or  just  after  being  weaned.  In  the  last 
two  years,  however,  I  have  had  puppies  show  signs  and  pass  worms  in  con- 
siderable quantities  as  young  as  three,  and  in  some  few  cases,  two  weeks 
old,  and  I  have  then  treated  them  with  small  doses  of  vermifuge,  but  they 
must  be  very  small  doses,  and  careful  in  what  you  use  at  this  age,  for  as  a 
rule,  very  little  medicine  should  be  given  to  a  puppy  before  it  is  weaned.  To 
be  safe  and  sure,  you  do  not  need  to  wait  for  the  usual  signs  of  worms  in 
puppies,  but  just  make  up  your  mind  to  the  fact  that  all  pups  are  born  with 
worms — and  you  won't  miss  it.  When  you  buy  a  puppy,  find  out  If  it  has 
been  treated;  if  not,  do  so  at  once,  for  you  can  be  sure  it  has  them,  and 
proper  remedies  are  now  made  that  are  perfectly  safe  to  use,  and  harmless 
should  puppy  not  have  any  worms. 

There  are  several  worm  remedies  made  for  dogs  that  are  safe  and  re- 
liable. When  I  have  to  give  puppies  treatment  for  worms  before  they  are 
weaned,  I  have  used  Clayton's  Vermifuge  in  small  doses,  and  with  good 
success,  (see  what  he  says  in  his  ad.  as  to  this),  and  also  "Vermilax,"  (see 
Vermilax  Co.'s  ad.  also).  Both  this  and  Clayton's  are  in  liquid  form,  and 
can  graduate  the  dose  easily.  As  some  remedies  are  put  up  in  capsules 
that  would  be  too  heavy  a  dose  for  puppies,  and  even  older  small  toy 
dogs.  An  overdose  might  not  kill  the  dog,  but  would  of  course  make  it 
sick.  I  also  use  "Sergeant's  Sure  Shot,"  and  have  for  years,  as  it  was  got- 
ten up  by  my  old  friend,  Polk  Miller.  It  is  put  up  in  liquid  form,  also  in 
capsules.  In  the  liquid  form  you  can  give  small  doses,  using  judgement 
as  to  age  and  breed.  I,  also  used  for  a  long  time,  Glover's  Vermifuge, 
and  it  is  an  old  and  reliable  remedy,  all  right  for  grown  dogs  and  larger 
breeds,  but  a  little  too  strong  for  puppies  and  toy  dogs,  unless  in  small  doses. 

There  are  several  remedies  advertised  as  quick  workers,  some  claiming 
"thirty  and  sixty  minute  results",  and  I  am  afraid  this  Is  too  quick  to  be 


 

safe  as  they  may  contain  Areca  Nut,  a  dangerous  drug  to  ever  use,  as  it 
shoots  through  the  dog  like  lightning,  but,  if  any  of  it  remains  in  the  dog, 
it  means  inflamation  of  the  intestines,  and  most  always  a  dead  dog.  It  is 
a  very  old  remedy,  too  old,  used  in  years  gone  by  when  they  did  not  know 
so  much  as  we  do  now.  In  my  article  against  Tape  Worms,  I  warned  against 
the  use  of  Areca  Nut. 

Better  give  too  small  a  dose,  than  an  over  dose,  of  any  Vermifuge, 
and  give  it  oftener,  or,  as  long  as  you  see  signs  of  the  dog  having  worms. 
The  three  principle  kinds  that  infest  dogs  are: 

First — The  Common  Round  or  Stomach  Worm,  of  a  pale,  pink  or  flesh 
color,  pointed  at  both  ends  and  from  two  to  six  inches  long;  in  appearance 
very  much  like  the  common  earth  or  fish  worm;  this  kind  is  most  common 
in  puppies. 

Second — The  Tape  Worm,  which  is  made  up  of  flat  sections  joined  to- 
gether, and  these  sections  being  from  a  quarter  to  an  inch  in  length,  and 
in  color  nearly  white,  the  tail  being  the  largest  and  longest  section,  which 
gradually  gets  smaller  and  shorter  toward  the  head  to  such  an  extent  that  it 
looks  to  the  naked  eye  as  fine  as  a  thread.  Under  a  strong  glass  this  part 
will  look  like  a  lot  of  very  small  beads  strung  on  a  fine  thread.  Here  is 
where  to  look  for  the  head,  which  is  described  by  Stonehenge  as  follows: 
"The  head  is  small,  and  generally  hemispherical,  broader  than  long,  and 
often  as  truncated  anteriorly;  the  four  mouths,  or  oscula,  are  situated 
on  the  anterior  surface,  and  surround  the  central  rostellum,  which  is  very 
short,  terminated  by  a  minute  opical  papilla  and  surrounded  by  a  double 
circle  of  small  recurved  hooks."  The  head  can  seldom  be  seen  or  found 
with  the  naked  eye.  It  is  larger  than  the  neck  but  yet  too  small  to  be 
seen  unless  under  a  glass. 

Third — The  Maw  Worm  (or  pin,  or  thread  worm,  as  it  is  variously 
called)  is  located  in  the  rectum  and  is  nearly  pink  in  color,  and  from  a 
half  to  an  inch  long.  These  are  the  least  dangerous  of  all  worms,  but 
cause  great  irritation.  They  are  passed  adhering  to  the  feces.  In  puppies 
these  sometimes  cause  partial  paralysis  which  disappears  after  the  worms 
are  passed.  Some  authors  claim  that  the  maw  worm  are  segments  of  the 
tape  worm,  but  I  think  it  is  a  separate  species  altogether.  The  common 
round  stomach  worms  which  inhabit  the  stomach  and  small  intestines  are 
most  to  be  feared  of  all,  being  more  peculiar  to  puppies,  causing  irritation 
of  the  stomach  and  intestines,  indigestion,  fits,  diarrhea,  and  obstruction 
of  the  bowels.  Your  puppy  has  a  much  greater  chance  to  live  when  the 
worms  are  gotten  rid  of,  as  their  presence  leads  to  so  many  dangerous 
complications. 

Fourth — Hook  Worms — these  you  will  find  treated  under  a  special 
article  elsewhere. 

Dalziel  says:  "The  varieties  of  worms  Infesting  dogs  are  very  num- 
erous, far  more  so  than  dog  owners  in  general  have  the  slightest  idea  of, 
but  some  varieties  fortunately  are  rare.  A  variety  has  been  found  in  the 
eye,  another  in  the  nasal  sinuses,  where  it  causes  great  irritation;  the  cruel 
Thread  Worm  finds  its  way  into  the  heart,  producing  a  most  painful  death; 
Borne  are  found  in  the  blood,  the  liver  has  its  parasite,  so  have  the  kid- 
ney* and  urethra." 

As  has  been  the  custom  of  writers  and  owners  of  dogs  to  classify  them 




under  the  headings  of  round-worm,  maw-worm  and  tape-worm,  I  have 
in  this  article  done  the  same  ,as  these  are  the  kinds  that  mostly  concern 
dog  owners. 

Symptoms  of  Stomach  Worms  in  young  puppies  are  plain  to  be  seen; 
they  pass  them,  also  vomit  them  up;  they  cause  Diarrhea,  and  you  will 
find  mucus,  or  slime,  and  sometimes  blood  in  the  passage.  You  will  also 
notice  a  distension  and  hardness  of  the  stomach  very  much  disproportion- 
ate to  amount  of  food  they  have  eaten  and  you  may  notice  the  puppy  drag- 
ging itself  on  its  stern  or  biting  at  its  tail.  In  older  dogs  most  of  these 
same  symptoms  appear,  as  well  as  others  here  enumerated;  a  foul  breath, 
nose  is  hot  and  dry,  hacking  cough,  fits,  vomiting  of  their  food  mixed  with 
mucus,  rough  and  staring  coat,  indigeston,  disturbed  sleep,  colic,  pains'  and 
emaciation. 

The  question  is  often  asked  at  what  period  after  service  should  a 
bitch  be  treated  for  worms,  or  rather  how  soon  before  whelping?  A  fort- 
night or  three  weeks  is  about  the  limit  after  service,  but  they  have  been 
treated  without  bad  result  within  three  weeks  of  whelping. 

If  you  have  your  puppies  confined  in  a  yard  it  is  very  easy  to  watch 
their  passages,  and  this  is  one  of  the  surest  ways  of  all;  then,  as  soon  as 
you  see  mucus  or  worms  passed  you  know  they  have  them,  and  can  go  to 
work  at  once  to  treat  them.  Now,  as  to  stomach  or  round  worms — if  they 
appear  before  pups  are  weaned  in  such  quantities  that  you  deem  it  advis- 
able or  safest  to  treat,  as  it  most  generally  is,  select  the  vermifuge  you 
wish  to  use  and  then  be  guided  as  to  size  of  dose  and  age  of  puppy. 

Now,  here,  on  this  most  important  subject  of  Worms,  I  want  to  say  all 
the  good  I  can  for  the  sake  of  saving  the  puppies.  You  will  find  advertised 
in  this  book  worm  remedies  made  by  Glover,  Clayton,  Polk  Miller,  and  the 
Vermilax  Company  and  the  C.  S.  R.  Remedy  Co.  Look  them  up  in  the 
very  interesting  and  valuable  lot  of  advertisements  you  will  find  in  this 
book  (as  beneficial  and  important,  even  if  they  are  "advertisements,"  and 
paid  for  to  insert),  as  in  using  these  already  prepared  vermifuges  you 
cannot  go  amiss  if  their  directions,  and  what  I  say  as  to  administering  them, 
is  followed.  I  have  used  every  one  of  them,  and  it  is  far  better  to  use 
some  one  of  these  well  known  worm  .remedies  that  are  made  for  dogs  by 
reliable  and  experienced  parties  in  treating  dogs,  than  to  take  chances  or 
go  to  the  trouble  of  having  other  prescriptions  filled.  I  am  not  getting 
paid  extra  to  recommend  anyone's  vermifuge,  for  I  would  not  do  so  unless 
I  thought  and  believed  the  article  would  save  puppies — my  main  object 
in  this  book  being  to  do  good  to  dogs.  I  could  give  you — as  most  dog 
books  do  give — a  lot  of  prescriptions,  but  only  give  one,  so  that  in  case 
you  do  not  happen  to  have  on  hand,  or  cannot  get  one  of  these  mentioned, 
then  you  could  get  this  one  filled  and  use  till  you  could  order  one  of  the 
others.  Right  here  I  want  to  say — never  use  areca  nut  for  worms  in  any 
form,  or  any  vermifuge  that  contains  this  dangerous  drug  if  you  know 
it,  for  while  it  expels  the  worms  by  the  "fast  train"  route,  it  also  kills 
more  dogs  by  far  than  it  ever  saves.  Areca  nut  is  a  relic  of  a  past  decade 
— avoid  its  use. 

The  following  article  on  Symptoms  of  Worms,  was  published  in  Field 
and  Fancy,  (I  think  written  by  F.  J.  Skinner),  and  certainly  worthy  of 
space  in  this  book: 


 

"What  are  the  symptoms  by  which  it  can  be  determined  that  a  dog 
Is  suffering  from  worms?  As  regards  puppies,  the  symptoms  are  very 
clear. 

They  begin  to  get  thin,  and  they  have  an  appearance  that  can  best 
be  described  by  the  not  very  euphonious  or  deiicate,  but  certainly  vivid, 
description  of  'pot-bellied.' 

This  means  that  the  round  worms  with  which  they  become  infested 
develop  to  such  an  extent  as  to  give  them  a  hanging  appearance,  which 
every  one  that  has  had  experience  in  raising  puppies  will  speedily  recognize 
as  symptomatic  of  the  presence  of  worms. 

The  puppies  become  very  voracious,  yet  do  not  seem  to  thrive,  and  in 
a  majority  of  cases  they  have  fits,  and  unless  relief  be  given  very  soon 
they  will  die  In  these  fits. 

Another  symptom  is  diarrhoea,  which,  of  course,  is  due  to  the  irritated 
condition  of  the  intestines. 

The  administration  of  worm  medicine  in  any  shape  or  form,  how- 
ever simple,  to  puppies  is  always  attended  with  no  small  amount  of  risk, 
and  for  this  reason,  as  it  seems  to  us — that  the  effect  of  a  mild  dose  of 
medicine  is  simple  to  stir  up  the  worms  when  a  puppy  is  badly  infested, 
which    is    practically    as    bad    as    giving    an    overstrong    dose. 

The  mild  dose  stirs  them  up  and  causes  a  fit,  when  the  overstrong  dose 
may  have  what  is  practically  a  poisonous  effect.  Repeat  the  dose  in  a  mild- 
er form  in  about  a  week,  and  then  it  will  be  safe  to  assume  that  the  puppy 
has  been  cleared  entirely.  After  this  take  the  precaution  to  give  from  time 
to  time  some  little  laxative  medicine.  In  this  way  you  can  effectively 
prevent  the  development  of  worms  to  any  serious  extent,  and  so  there  will 
not  be  any  further  need  for  the  stronger  vermifuges  which  are  required 
when  a  puppy  is   badly   infested. 

The  following  are  among  the  many  symptomatic  indications  of  worms: 

The  Eyes. — Pupils  almost  constantly  dilated;  the  eyelids  nearly  closed, 
as  though  aching,  which  is  aggravated  by  motion;  sensitive  to  light;  the 
whites  of  eyes  red  and  in  jested;  patient  acts  as  though  sight  were  de- 
fective, being  guarded  in  its  movements;  eyeballs  roll  about  in  distorted 
fashion;    opacity  of  the  lens  and   amaurotic   conditions. 

The  Nose. — Great  irritation,  evidenced  by  frequent  rubbing  on  the 
ground  or  with  the  paws.  . 

The  Tongue. — The  dorsum  centrally  coated  with  yellow  fur;  on  the 
sides  appear  round  or  oval  spots  of  a  pink  or  deep  crimson  color,  occasion- 
ally slightly  elevated  when  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea  are  present  accom- 
paniments, and  spots  are  observed  through  the  coating  of  fur. 

The  Mouth. — Dribbling  of  slimy  saliva,  especially  during  sleep;  breath 
fetid  and  very  offensive;  frequent  grinding  of  the  teeth,  both  when  asleep 
and   awake. 

Cough. — Dry,   short   and    spasmodic. 

Appetite. — Capricious,  depraved,  frequently  ravenous,  occasionally  in 
abeyance. 

Heart. — Palpitation;  violence  and  irregular  action;  sharp  pains,  indn 
cated  by  crying  out  and  biting  at  the  ribs  over  tiie  seat  of  heart;  very 
rapid  breathing. 

Abdomen.-f-Swollen  and   hard   to   the   touch;    griping  pains,   indicated 

by  rolling  about;  lying  on  stomach  with  outstretched  legs;  flatulenc*; 
voniition. 

Anus. — Considerable  local  irritation,  indicated  by  dragging  along  on 
the  hindquarters;  protrusion  of  the  mucous  membrane  and  prolapse  of  the 
parts. 

Skin. — Coat  rough,  stands  on  end;  abundant  scurf;  herpetic  eruptions; 
thick  and  lacking  usual  pliability. 

Foeces. — Constipated,  with  frequent  ineffective  efforts  to  pass;  coated 
with  slimy  mucus;  or  loose,  papescent,  mixed  with  slimy  mucus;  great 
straining;  dark  colored,  sometimes  bloody,  and  very  offensive;  discharges 
of  slimy  mucus  only  are  frequently  observable;  at  such  times  evacuations 
are  white  or  greenish,  attended  with  much  straining. 

Urine, — Passed  with  difficulty;  pale  or  milky  appearance;  or  whit* 
and  thick,  passed  involuntarily. 

Nervous  System. — Convulsions,  cramps,  paralysis,  giddiness,  irritabil- 
ity, sleeplessness,  depression,  restlessness;  suddenly  jumps  up  out  of  sleep, 
whines  and  cries  out  a  with  fear;  epilepy;  chorea. 

The  presence  of  worms  naturally  tends  to  reduce  a  dog  in  condition, 
and  many  dogs  remain  permanently  so  until  a  thorpugh  dosing  is  given 
them,  which  is  effective  in  ridding  them  of  the  nuisance." 

As  to  worms,  it  is  never  necessary  to  consult  a  veterinarian,  in  fact, 
safer  not  to  do  so,  as  too  many  of  them  prescribe  and  use  medicines  that 
are  dangerous,  have  to  be  given  too  often,  and  in  too  large  quantities.  In 
case  you  are  where  you  cannot  get  the  vermifuges  I  have  mentioned,  and 
cannot  wait  till  you  could  get  them,  then  here  is  a  prescription  for  worms: 

Oil  of  male  shield  fern    1   dram 

Santonine    8   grains 

Fluid   extract  of  jalap    1   ounce 

Olive    oil     1   ounce 

Oil  of  anise    20   drops 

"Dose  for  puppies  two  to  four  months  old,  one  and  a  half  teaspoons- 
ful;  seven  to  ten  months  old,  two;  and  grown  dogs,  two  and  a  half 
or  three  teaspoonfuls,  given  on  an  empty  stomach. 
r - 

"Above  doses  are  for  dogs  that  weigh  when  grown  from  50  pounds 
to  100  pounds.  For  smaller  dogs  weighing  about  25  pounds  take  two- 
thirds,  and  toy  dogs  of  about  10  pounds  take  one-third  the  above  doses. 
In  treating  puppies  with  this  remedy,  give  only  one  dose;  on  old  dogs,  re- 
peat once  or  twice." 

There  is  no  use  giving  any  worm  remedy  unless  the  dog  has  been 
prepared  for  it  by  a  proper  fasting,  and  the  medicine  is  put  in  them  when 
bowels  are  empty.  You  must  catch  the  worms  by  fishing  for  them  when 
they  are  hungry,  the  exception  of  this  rule  being,  of  course,  in  the  case  of 
treating  puppies  yet  unweaned.  This  is,  as  before  said,  not  so  often  ne- 
cessary. 

Dr.  Clayton  furnishes  me  directions  as  to  giving  his  Vermifuge  as 
follows:  "The  dose  for  toy  dog  ten  days  old  is  two  to  five  drops,  twenty 
days  old  fiv«  to  ten  drops,  thirty  days  old  ten  to  thirty  drops.     Medium  and 

large  breeds,  twice  and  three  times  the  amount,  to  be  varied  by  the  size 
and  strength  of  the  animal,  and  can  be  given  with  perfect  safety.  I  have 
yet  to  see  one  unpleasant  result  of  the  Vermifuge,  and  I  will  pay  for  any 
pup  that  has  been  properly  treated  with  my  Vermifuge  in  time,  that  dies 
of  worms.  I  will  put  up  twice  the  value  of  the  pup,  and  after  I  have  given 
a  dose  of  my  Vermifuge,  if  the  pup  dies  and  there  is  found  one  worm,  the 
owner  takes  the  money;  if  there  are  no  worms,  the  owner  stands  the  loss. 
I  absolutely  guarantee  to  remove  all  worms  with  my  remedies,  without 
injury  to  the  animal,  and  you  cannot  speak  too  highly  of  my  worm  reme- 
dies." 

Dr.  Clayton  further  says:  "Puppies  never  do  so  well  as  when  get- 
ting the  nourishment  from  the  mother,  and  if  it  is  possible  to  rid  them  of 
worms  at  this  t'me  it  is  very  much  to  be  desired,  this  can  be  accomplished 
by  giving  Clayton's  Vermifuge,  as  it  is  a  safe  remedy  and  can  be  given  to 
puppies  at  ten  days'  old,  any  breed.  The  Vermifuge  should  never  be  given 
oftener  than  once  a  week.  It  is  a  good  plan  to  give  all  puppies  the  Vermi- 
fuge, say  once  a  week  from  ten  days  old  until  they  are  three  months  old, 
as  you  are  then  absolutely  sure  your  puppies  are  free  from  worms,  and 
barring  all  contagious  diseases  will  soon  arrive  at  the  teething  period." 

Now,  what  I  have  written  and  furnished  you  in  the  foregoing  is  meant 
for  Stomach  or  Round  Worms  espec'ally.  Any  of  these  Vermifuges  might 
also  expel  tape  worm,  but  I  now  treat  of  it,  and  a  remedy  that  is  certain, 
safe  and  sure,  one  made  and  intended  to  be  used  on  human's  for  tape 
worm,  but  adapted  to  and  used  on  the  dog,  by  the  writer: 

Tape  Worm — Symptoms  of  Tape  Worm. — An  irregular  and  frequently 
a  ravenous  appetite  co-existing  with  considerable  emaciation,  the  food  taken 
seeming  to  do  the  dog  no  good.  The  breath  is  offensive,  and  nose  hot  and 
dry.  The  coat  has  a  rough,  harsh,  staring,  unhealthy  look,  the  hair  looking 
dead.  I  have,  however,  found  tape  worms  in  a  pug  dog  that  had  a  sleek 
and  glossy  coat  and  was  fat  and  healthy.  They  often  have  a  depraved  ap- 
petite, looking  for  and  eating  filth.  Parts  of  the  worm  may  sometimes  be 
seen  hanging  from  the  anus  of  the  dog,  this  being  the  case  in  the  pug  spoken 
of,  and  who  had  never  shown  any  signs  of  having  such  trouble,  as  she  was 
a  bitch  that  had  had  several  litters  of  pups. 

I  prefer  mixing  it  in  molasses,  as  this  is  sweet  and  also  a  physic.  It 
should  work  him  in  from  half  an  hour  to  an  hour,  but  sometimes  takes 
longer. 

Another   way   to  give  it  is  by  mixing  the  powder  in   castor  or  olive  oil, 
the  way  it  is  given  by  doctors  in  treating  human  beings  for  tape  worm. 

Now,  arrange  to  have  it  so  you  can  examine  the  passages  by  dog  being 
confined  in  a  yard.  Be  there  yourself  till  it  has  worked  the  dog,  don't  give 
it  up  and  go  away,  for  this  catching  tape  worms  is  not  easy  fishing,  and  you 
must  give  it  your  attention.  Examine  each  stool  and  carefully  pick  out 
the  part  of  worm  it  may  contain,  wash  this  off  and  put  it  on  a  sheet  of 
paper  so  you  can  examine  it  and  see  what  luck  you  had  in  that  haul,  or  if 
you  got  the  head  that  time.  You  can  buy  at  a  small  cost  a  magnifying  glass, 
as  the  head  cannot  be  seen  with  the  naked  eye.  As  soon  as  medicine  is 
through  working,  feed  up  your  dog,  for  he  will  relish  a  good  meal.  If  you 
find  the  head,  then  I  would  let  the  dog  go  for  a  week  before  you  give  him 


 

another  dose,  but  if  you  have  not  found  the  head  then  repeat  dose  in  two 
or  three  days. 

In  tape  worm  cases  the  treatment  must  be  repeated  and  persevered 
with  until  the  head  of  the  worm  is  expelled,  and  in  all  cases  the  worms  and 
all  discharged  feces  should  be  either  burned  or  destroyed  by  mixing  it  with 
some  powerful  disinfectant  and  then  buried,  to  prevent  propagation  of  the 
parasites  by  their  ova. 

You  may  get  one  worm  or  more,  and  yet  the  dog  may  have  more  tape 
worms,  which  treat  for  later  on  if  symptoms  again  appear.  Here  is  another 
prescription   which   is  recommended   by  Dalz'el: 

Treatment  for  Tape  Worm. — I  will  now. divulge  the  secret  of  the  rem- 
edy that  I  have  sold  for  years  under  the  name  of  "Eberhart's  Tape  Worm 
Remedy,"  and  which  has  never  failed  and  never  will  fail  to  remove  tape 
worms,  head  and  all,  if  directions  are  followed.  Kamala  is  the  article.  It 
is  a  product  of  India,  a  fine  granular  powder  of  a  reddish,  brown  color, 
obtained  from  the  minute  glands  adhering  to  the  capsules  of  Rottlera 
tinctoria. 

Some  ten  years  ago  my  pug  "Boycott"  was  afflicted  with  tape  worm,  not 
only  one  but  several  (as  is  sometimes  the  case),  and  I  tried  every  known 
remedy  and  each  case  failed  to  rid  him  of  the  worms,  besides  nearly  ruin- 
ing the  dog.  I  paid  one  tape  worm  doctor  (who  treated  people)  ten  dollars 
to  work  on  my  dog  one  entire  day,  and  lie  fa'ied  to  get  the  head  of  the 
worm,  and  the  poor  dog  was  sick  for  many  days  afterward,  due  to  the 
severe  ordeal  and  treatment.  I  then  discovered  "Kamala,"  which  had  been 
used  for  human  beings,  and  in  less  than  a  week  I  had  removed  three  tape 
worms    (including   heads)    aggregating    eighty    feet    in    length. 

Kamala  is  entirely  harmless,  never  causing  irritation  or  inflammation, 
and  unlike  other  remedies,  its  use  does  not  leave  the  patient  in  a  weakened 
condition,  but  exactly  the  reverse  in  this  respect- — the  dog  feeling  better, 
is  braced  up,  acts  happy  and  better  than  before  taking  it.  So  harmless  do 
I  know  it  to  be,  that  many  times  I  have  given  it  as  an  ordinary  physic 
when  I  did  not  have  castor  oil  on  hand.  It  is  the  greatest  tape  worm 
remedy  ever  used  and  I  now  give  up  the  secret  purely  for  the  good  of  dogs, 
as  I  have  sold  it  for  years  and  am  receiving  orders  for  it  almost  daily, 
it  having  been  a  profitable  part  of  my  business. 

It  is  also  a  very  good  remedy  for  removing  round  worms.  Being  a  com- 
paratively new  remedy  at  this  writing,  not  all  druggists  keep  it,  and  espe- 
cially in  smaller  towns,  and  if  your  druggist  has  not  got  it  send  to  me 
and  I  can  mail  it  to  you,  as  my  druggist  in  Cincinnati  keeps  it  in  stock, 
and  always  fresh,  which  is  highly  important,  as  it  must  be  fresh  and  kept 
in  a  tightly  corked  bottle.  For  Fifty  Cents  I  can  send  it  by  mail — enough 
usually  for  any  dog.  This  one  remedy  alone  is  worth  the  cost  of  a  good 
many  copies  of  this  book. 

Never  use  areca  nut,  the  relict  of  a  past  age,  which  has  for  so  long  a 
time  been  used  for  tape  worm,  and  has  killed  more  dogs  than  it  ever  cured, 
a  deadly  and  dangerous  remedy. 

How  to  Use  Kamala. 

Fast  your  dog  for  twenty-four  hours   (a  day  and  a  night)   and  then  in 

the  morning  give  him  the  dose.  A  strong  and  mature  dog  should  be  kept 
without  food  for  twenty-four  hours,  weakly  dogs  and  puppies,  a  less  period, 
but  sufficient  to  empty  the  stomach,  for  it  is  no  use  giving  vermifuge  on  a 
full  stomach,   except  to  young  puppies,  of  course. 

Weigh  your  dog  and  if  he  is  ordinarily  strong  and  healthy,  the  size 
dose  to  give  is  two  grains  for  each  pound  the  dog  weighs.  If  the  dog  is 
not  in  usual  health  or  is  a  weakly  sort,  try  it  first — one  and  a  half  grains 
to  each  pound.  Kamala  is  tasteless,  and  unless  the  dog  gets  the  idea  you 
are  "giving  him  medicine"  it  is  easily  administered  as  follows:  I  give  it 
mixed  in  molasses  and  then  put  it  in  his  mouth,  rubbing  whatever  is  left 
on  your  finger,  on  his  nose  and  he  will  lick  it  off  himself. 

In  using  Kamala,  should  you  give  an  overdose,  no  harm  will  result 
from  it,  as  it  is  not  a  drug.  An  even  teaspoonful  of  Kamala  is  sixty  grains, 
and  taking  this  as  a  guide,  you  can  come  near  enough  to  the  proper  dose 
for  any  dog,  if  you  have  the  dog's  weight,  as  for  instance,  if  your  dog 
weighed  sixty  pounds,  then  the  dose  would  be  two  teaspoonfuls,  and  you 
can  get  at  it  this  way,  or  a  better  plan  is  to  get  your  druggist  to  weigh  it 
out  into  proper  sized  doses,  telling  him  weight  of  dog  and  that  the  dose 
is   two   grains   to   each  pound   dog   weighs. 

You  may  find  difficulty  in  getting  Kamala,  many  druggists  not  keep- 
ing it,  and  some  of  them  even  not  knowing  as  to  it,  and  if  you  cannot 
obtain  it  of  your  druggist,  I  can  send  it  to  you  by  mail,  two  hundred  and 
forty  grains  for  fifty  cents.  It  must  be  fresh,  and  what  you  do  not  use 
must  be  kept  in  a  tight  glass  stoppered  bottle  to  retain  its  virtues  for  fu- 
ture use.  Kamala  is  the  greatest  tape  worm  remedy  of  all.  I  am  satis- 
fied and  sure  that  it  is,  and  since  I  first  made  it  public  in  my  second  edi- 
tion of  this  book,  several  makers  of  worm  remedies  are  using  it  in  their 
worm  preparations.  One  regular  physician  in  Mississippi  who  had  prac- 
ticed medicine  for  forty  years,  and  who  bred  hounds,  not  knowing  of 
Kamala,  ordered  it,  and  later  wrote  me  that  from  one  dog  he  got  eighty- 
two  feet  of  tape  worm,  and  that  he  should  adopt  and  use  Kamala  here- 
after in   his  practice  on   humans. 

Dalziel  says  of  Tape  Worms. — "These  are,  as  the  name  indicates,  the 
flat  worms  which  are  often  seen  evacuated  with  the  feces  in  small  sections 
of  half  an  inch  or  less,  when  they  are  usually  called  'maw-worms;'  or  at 
times  chains  of  them  may  be  seen  hanging  from  the  anus,  when  being 
expelled  naturally  or  under  the  action  of  medicine. 

"No  less  than  a  dozen  tapeworms  select  the  dog  as  their  host.  They 
have  a  remarkable  life-history,  and  it  is  as  well  for  the  dog  owner  to 
know  something  as  to  this,  as  he  is  often  puzzled  to  think  how  this  or 
that  dog  became  infested. 

"It  will  therefore  be  well  to  see  how  an  adult  tape  worm  is  made  up. 
If  examined,  it  will  be  found  to  consist  of  a  head,  or  scolex,  and  a  series 
of  segments,  scientifically  known  as  metameres.  These  latter  are  con- 
stantly being  budded  off  from  the  head,  and  assume  forms  varying  with 
their  age.  Thus  those  nearest  the  head  are  the  youngest,  and  those  at 
the  other  extremity  the  oldest.  It  is  these  last  which  one  sees  from  time 
to  time  pass  with  the  faecal  discharges.  They  are,  in  fact,  the  ripe  segments, 
or  proglottids,  which  detach  themselves  from  the  hind  portion,  and  each 
portion  thus  freed  is  endowed  with  reproductive  organs.     In   tim©  these 


—  

detached  portions  die  away,  but  the  eggs  contained  In  them  have  been 
impregnated  by  spermatozoa  and  simply  await  another  host  to  begin  anew 
the  cycle  of  existence.  The  eggs  thus  scattered  broadcast  are  not  influ- 
•  enced  by  extremes  of  heat  or  cold,  dryness  or  moisture,  nor  does  time  seem 
to  destroy  their  germinating  power.  From  this  it  will  readily  be  seen 
how  important  it  is  to  burn  all  excreta  from  dogs  infested  with  tape  worms. 
When  the  ripe  segments  leave  the  dog  per  anus  they  are  charged  with 
ova,  and  possessing  the  power  of  motion,  wriggle  among  the  hair,  where 
the  lice  and  fleas  devour  the  eggs  and  develop  into  the  cryptocysts  found 
by  Grassi  free  in  the  abdominal  cavity.  The  dog  again,  in  searching  for 
his  tormentors,  nibbles  and  licks  his  skin  and  coat,  and  in  this  way  swal- 
lows the  insect,  and  when  the  contained  cryptocyst  is  set  free  in  the  dog's 
stomach  the  tapeworm  is  once  more  developed.  The  nimble  flea  travels 
so  readily  from  one  dog  to  another,  carrying  this  tape  worm  with  him, 
that  we  have  here  an  explanation  of  what  has  puzzled  so  many — how  a 
carefully  fed  and  groomed  house  dog  becomes  infested  with  tape  worm?" 

Maw  Worms. — Treatment  for  Maw  Worms. — These  can  be  reached  and 
expelled  by  the  following  injection  per  rectum:  Aloes,  1  dram.  Put  the 
aloes  into  a  tea  cup  of  warm  water  and  then  put  it  into  a  bottle.  Inject 
once  every  day,  until  no  more  are  to  be  seen  passing  from  the  dog.  Use 
rubber  syringe  and  hold  rear  part  of  the  dog  up  for  five  minutes  after 
injecting.  It  will  do  no  harm  and  facilitate  matters  by  having  given  an 
hour  beforehand  a  dose  of  Kamala  (see  tape  worm),  as  the  Kamala  will 
give  dog  a  thorough  cleaning  out,  and  with  this  start  expel  a  lot  of  these 
worms.  The  Kamala  need  only  be  given  once  in  treating  for  maw  worms 
— the  first  day  you  begin  treating  dog. 

Another  good  injection  for  rectum  or  maw  worms  is  a  solution  of 
quassia  chips.     A  handful  steeped  in  water  for  six  hours.
