asthmatic troubles which while not usually fatal do not \\nprove amenable to treatment \\n\\nAn important feature of the treatment is attention to the diet which \\nshould be of a nonstimulating character First relieve the animal by giving \\nthe following antispasmotic drops Compound spirits of sulphuric ether and \\ntincture of opium equal parts which keep in a cool place and well corked \\n\\nThe dose for a 15lb to 30lb dog would be a small teaspoonful in a couple \\nof tablespoonfuls of gruel or milk This however only relieves and does \\nnot cure The dog must now have frequent doses of a brisk aperient and \\na pill of the following prescription will be found very beneficial given every \\nnight for a while \\n\\nPodophyllin 6 grains \\n\\nCompound extract of colocynth 30 grains \\n\\nPowdered rhubarb 4 8 grains \\n\\nExtract of henbane 36 grains \\n\\nMix and divide into twentyfour pills \\n\\nSmall breeds such as Pugs or Toy Poodles give half of one of these \\npills \\n\\nA little warm broth after the pill will assist its action Feed rather \\noftener than you do your well dogs but in small quantities Make dog take \\nmore exercise every day which will cause him to more readily eat coarser \\nfood The chance of a complete cure is not encouraging in a confirmed or \\nchronic case but the regular use of the following pills will have a won \\nderful effect in counteracting severe paroxysms \\n\\nPowdered ipecacuanha 6 grains \\n\\nPowdered opium 6 grains \\n\\nCompound squill pill 24 grains \\n\\nPowdered gum ammoniacum 24 grains \\n\\nPowdered licorice 24 grains \\n\\nPowdered rhubarb 12 grains \\n\\nMix and make into twentyfour pills \\n\\nThe dose for a 15lb to 40lb dog one pill morning and night Small \\ner than 15lbs half a pill \\n\\nWhenever severe fits of coughing with difficulty of breathing occur \\nif the antispasmodic drops mentioned in first article are not handy chloro \\ndine may be given in the same way as the drops the dose being from \\ntwenty to thirty drops Much relief can be given to asthmatical dogs by \\nconfining them in a close box or kennel and filling it with the smoke of \\nthorn apple This may be done twice a day but care should be taken \\nwith such patients that they are not exposed to any sudden change of tem \\nperature whether from heat or cold or the reverse \\n\\nOr in place of this during acute attacks when the breathing is very \\nlabored relief may be obtained by inhalations of the fumes of burning \\ntar resin or creosote \\n\\nAn asthmatic form of breathing is frequently found in connection with \\ntumors involving the respiratory tract Such cases are incurable and it is \\nthe most merciful procedure to put the animal to a painless death \\n\\nHarry W Lacy has the following to say as to asthma and I append it \\nalso for the benfit it may do \\n\\n\\nAsthma is a very common ailment among sporting dogs and is \\nbrought on by repeated exposure followed by inattention If the simple \\nduty of making a dog comfortable be attended to at the close of each days \\nwork there need be little fear of anything like this ensuing It is not \\nactually the exposure to the weather that causes a dog to have lung trou \\nble because when a dog is out exposed he is constantly on the move and \\nthe circulation keeps up so that it is not possible for him to contract a \\nchill but the chill is contracted when the animal returns home and lies \\ndown in a wet condition Then the blood ceases to circulate as rapidly \\nas during exercise and the animal becomes shivery and a cold develops \\nThis repeated a few times more or less will end in a cough and asthma \\nwill ensue \\n\\nWhen once a dog has suffered from an attack of asthma there always \\nremains with him a predisposition to a renewal of the trouble It is a most \\ndistressing complaint and in the case of an animal like the dog which leads \\nor should lead an active outdoor life it is almost impossible to effect a \\npermanent cure Asthma differs from bronchitis in several ways It comes \\non in paroxysms which gradually get worse and worse until finally the \\nanimal is suffocated The treatment usually adopted consists in placing the \\nanimal in a room or chamber where a kettle is constantly boiling so that \\nthe atmosphere is kept continually moist â€” as moist warmth does as much \\ngood as anything to give relief in such cases As regards medicine some \\nof the ordinary cough remedies may be tried the best thing perhaps being \\nmixtifre of oxymel or squill and glycerine in equal parts to which a large \\nparegoric elixir is added The dog should have this about three times a \\nday \\n\\nAnother very good thing to do in connection with any treatment you use \\nis cut up an onion small and fine anoint with a drop or two no more or \\nit will blister of kerosene is excellent for asthma and bronchitis \\n\\nThis then put into a cotton cloth and tied around the dogs neck will \\nafford relief in breathing The onion should be renewed by a fresh one \\n\\nHouse dogs suffer greatly from overindulgence errors in diet and lack \\nof exercise which causes them to put on flesh rapidly These conditions \\nproduce derangements of the heart lungs and circulatory system that fre \\nquently result in a morbid condition of the system known as asthma In \\nflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the bronchial tubes also \\nproduces this disease so that colds and inhalations of noxious gases and \\nvapors are common causes \\n\\nThe disease is easily recognized and there is no danger of confounding \\nit with other affections of the chest It is not liable to prove fatal but \\nseriously affects a dogs usefulness and will unquestionably shorten the \\nanimals life \\n\\nSymptoms The patient shows great distress and difficulty in breathing \\nparticularly after slight exertion and suffers more or less from suffocation \\nRespirations are not increased in number but are labored and jerky and \\nhave a wheezy croupy sound during expiration There is generally a \\npeculiar cough The nostrils are dilated and the expression is anxious and \\npitiful The coat of overfed dogs suffering from asthma is rough and \\n\\ndirty and dry and harsh to the touch The skin is often covered with a \\nmangylooking scurf \\n\\nTreatment A radical cure of this disease is seldom effected but much \\ncan be done to improve the animals condition During an acute attack \\nof the disease prompt relief will be afforded by giving an emetic of ten \\nto twenty grains of sulphate of zinc or thirty grains of ipecac The \\nbowels should be kept open with cascara sagrada or olive oil \\n\\nMuch relief can be afforded to dogs suffering from the spasmodic \\nform of the disease by confining them in a small rocm and burning on a \\npan of coals one ounce of stramonium leaves and a drachm of nitrate of \\npotassa \\n\\nThe following prescription can then be used with good results Potassa \\niodidi two drams spirits ammonia arom one ounce tincture quassiae and \\naquae of each two ounces Dose one teaspoonful three times a day \\n\\nGive the patient slow walking exercise restrict the diet prevent the \\naccumulation of flesh as much as possible and aim to secure the best physi \\ncal condition possible \\n\\nApoplexy â€” See Fits \\n\\nAbscess â€” Pus or matter forming in or among the tissues is abscess \\nIt may be due to a blow an accident or caused by locil or general in \\nflammation A bitch may after whelping have one of the teats dammed \\nup which gives rise to lacol inflammation which would end in abscess \\nThere is unusual heat of the parts while the abscess is forming a hard \\nlump at first but as the matter forms this becomes softer and is movable \\nunder pressure of the hand Should it form very slowly hasten its forma \\ntion by hot fomentations which must be used continually for some time \\nand afterwards cover the parts to prevent reaction from cold air If you \\ncan keep a poultice on the part this is very useful Get from your druggist \\na piece of spongia piline satuate it with warm water and apply with the \\nwaterproof side out When the under part of the abscess is soft and moves \\nreadily under pressure it is ready for opening To open it take the lancet \\nbetween finger and thumb and plunge it well into the center making a \\nclean downward cut to insure good drainage press out the matter bathe \\nwith warm water and keep it clean which in most cases will be kept so \\nby the dogs tongue if on part of body where he can reach it If not then \\napply Peroxyde of Hydrogen three or four times a day \\n\\nIn cases where the abscess is deepseated the veterinary surgeon alone \\nshould use the knife A light and nutritious diet should be given and in \\nmany cases no medicine is required but a mild purge can be given when \\nit is forming Should dog be much reduced and his appetite impaired after \\nan abscess a short treatmentof Sergeants or Claytons Condition Pills will \\ndo al ot of good Abscesses forming n lung disease would discharge the \\nmatter through the nose also be coughed up while in the uterus it would \\nbe by the vagina Other internal organs may be the seat of abscesses but \\nnone of these cases can be treated by the amateur but should be intrusted \\nto the veterinary surgeon \\n\\n\\nPERIRECTAL ABSCESS \\n\\nIn a large number of cases â€” in fact nearly every one â€” of distemper \\nrectal abscesses will be found To those who do not clearly understand the \\nbest method of handling them we make the following suggestions \\n\\nTake the dog carefully between the knees and bend the tail sharply \\nupward This will cause the rectum to project With the thumb and finger \\npress firmly upon the projection as if to extract the milk from a cows \\nteat Use considefable force If there is an abscess this will break it and \\npress out the pus Be careful that the pus does not fly into the eyes \\nRepeat this operation every day so long as there is pus You will find \\nthis is a material aid in effecting a cure \\n\\nAbortion â€” Strictly speaking abortion means the expulsion of the \\nfoetus before it is sufficiently matured for independent life but applied to \\nthe lower animals it is generally used to mean premature parturition as \\nwell Abortion is comparatively rare in dogs but premature whelping \\nespecially just a week or so before the pups are due is by no means un \\ncommon The causes of abortion and premature parturition are various A \\nlow diet causing extreme paverty when the system requires extra support \\nfor the growth of the unborn pups and the secretion of milk for them \\nafterwards is likely to cause it and on the other hand a plethoric state \\nof the body from overfeeding and want of exercise is also a likely cause \\nand very severe exercise jumping from a height or over fences and what \\nis too common blows or kicks on the abdomen It may also be brought \\non by drinking foul water eating putrid food or anything likely to cause \\ninflammation of the bowels violent diarrhea and consequent straining \\nYoung bitches bred from before the system is matured and old wornout \\nones are most likely to abort Preventive measures consist in general \\nattention to health both in regard to the food and water given and the \\nsanitary condition of the kennel and the permitting of regular but not \\nviolent exercise and in selecting only for breeding purposes bitches that \\nare matured and in vigorous health When a bitch has had her pups \\nbefore the full time she should not be again bred from until at least one \\nperiod of oestrum has passed \\n\\nAnaemia Poverty of Blood is shown by paleness of the mucous \\nmembranes weak and slow pulse and heartbeat lack of energy depression \\nand lassitude As the disease progresses the eye sinks becoming dull the \\ngait is staggering the breathing becomes labored and wheezy and the dog \\ngradually sinks \\n\\nThe causes are poor food exhaustive demands on stud dogs excessive \\nsecretion of milk and allowing bitches to suckle puppies too long Anaemia \\nmay also be the result of some other disease impoverishing the system \\nand it is not infrequently a consequence of the dog harboring worms Give \\nin small quantities and frequently the most nourishing foods â€” milk flesh \\nbroths etc â€” pepsin porci to assist digestion and wine of iron or syrup of \\nphosphates as a tonic Sergeants Claytons or Eberharts condition pills \\nare a good tonic At the same time see that the dog is warmly housed \\nand that he gets plenty of sunlight and fresh air \\n\\nAsphyxia â€” Inability to breathe as the result of nearly drowning In \\ntreating never attempt to make dog swallow while in an unconscious state \\ninject stimulants under the skin such as from ten to twenty drops of \\nbrandy Dash hot and cold water over the head alternately and make the \\nattempt of artificial respiration as follows when due to partial drowning \\nHold the dog up with his head downward for a minute so as to allow the \\nwater to run out of his lungs then place the dog on his back draw the \\ntongue out and with the hand placed on the lower part of the chest where \\nthe latter meets the abdomen press downwards and forwards with some \\nlittle force then suddenly raise the hand to allow the chest to expand \\nThis should be repeated every three or four seconds \\n\\nBladder Inflammation of the â€” The symptoms are great pain on pres \\nsure over the region of the bladder the urine passed is scant in quantity \\nbut at frequent intervals and evidently with great pain It frequently comes \\nfrom a blow but is also produced by long exposure to cold or wet and often \\nthe result of giving too much cantharides and turpentine Sometimes due \\nto stricture of the urethra urinary passage or calculi stone The \\ntreatment consists of first giving a brisk purgative and should this not act \\nit should be assisted by clysters of lukewarm water or thin gruel or a \\nhot bath The acute symptoms having passed give 3 gr to 5 gr of benzoic \\nacid in pill form three times a day If the urine is not freely passed the \\ncatheter should be used in the manner detailed under heading of Paralysis \\nof the Bladder When the bowels have been opened give a dose every \\nsix hours of the following fever mixture \\n\\nPowdered nitre 1 dram \\n\\nSweet spirit of nitre 12 ounce \\n\\nMindererus spirit 1 2 ounce \\n\\nWine of antimony 1 dram \\n\\nTincture of digitalis y2 dram \\n\\nWater 4 ounces \\n\\nMix Dose for a dog 25lb to 30lb weight one tablespoonful every \\n\\nfour hours in a little gruel Smaller dogs not quite so much From \\n50lbs up a tablespoonful and a half as a dose \\nâ€ \\n\\nThe patient will experience relief of the parts are bathed continuously \\nwith a warm infusion of poppyheads or warm water alone care being \\ntaken that he is not afterward exposed to cold The clogs diet should be \\nlight and nourishing \\n\\nBladder Paralysis â€” of This affection is shown by the constant efforts \\n\\nof the dog to urinate and inability to do so the water coming away in \\ndribbles It may arise from stone in the bladder A common cause is over \\ndistension of the bladder caused by keeping dogs where they will not \\nurinate Some dogs will not do so when shut up in a room or when on \\nthe chain hence the necessity too often neglected of taking dogs off the \\nbenches at exhibitions at regular intervals This compulsory retention of \\nurine produces spasm of the neck of the bladder and paralysis â€” loss of the \\n\\n\\nnecessary muscular power â€” follows It may also be the result of injury to \\nthe spine or of debilitating disease The effect of continued hot fomen \\ntations should be tried and if these fail the urine should be drawn off by \\nmeans of a catheter Passing a catheter is a very simple matter The \\ndog should be placed upon his back and the prepuce pressed back so as to \\nbring the penis into view the catketer should then be dressed with a little \\nolive oil or vaseline and passed gently into the opening at the point of the \\npenis This will introduce it into the bladder when the piece of wire with \\nwhich the instrument is provided should be withdrawn Should the urine \\nnot flow freely the dog can be stood upon its legs keeping the catheter \\nin position If a catheter is not at hand pressure with both hands through \\nthe abdominal walls in the region of the bladder will empty it of its con \\ntents If paralysis of the hind legs is present an assistant should raise \\nthe body from the ground by means of the tail whilst the operator is press \\ning the sides \\n\\nDuring convalescence give barleywater to drink and soft nourishing \\nfood â€” porridge and milk broth and bread etc \\n\\nThe following on this subject is valuable This disease occurs some \\ntimes from keeping dogs of very clean habits shut up with no opportunity \\nto relieve themselves The bladder becomes overdistended paralyzing the \\nparts It may also be the result of a general paralysis following an injury \\nto the spine the brain or some part of the nervous system The dog at first \\nis unable to pass water and later it dribbles from him The first thing \\nto do is to relieve the bladder If there is no mechanical obstruction this \\ncan be done by pressure over the walls of the abdomen If this fails a \\ncatheter must be passed in fact it is the safest thing to do for when an \\nattempt is made to empty he bladder by applying force from the outsire \\nthere is danger of rupturing the parts The catheter for a small dog \\nshould be No 00 for terriers No 1 for setters and pointers No 2 In \\nthe event of a small gravel lodging in the passage it is usually removed \\nby carefully passing a small grooved silver probe To tone up the bladder \\nnux vomica is the mast useful drug The dose is from one to seven drops \\nof the tincture three times a day in a teaspoonful of water given after feed \\ning \\n\\nBleeding From the Stomach The vomiting of blood is not of ordinary \\n\\noccurrence and may be the result of many causes If due to a recent in \\njury or breaking down of the tissues it will be bright red in color if the \\nblood is coming from the vens it will be of darker hue and if it has re \\nmained in the stomach some time it will be of coffee color In treating give \\nthe stomach at least twentyfour hours rest or feed only milk and water \\nand every three hours give from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful of the \\nfollowing Tincture thalaspi twentyfour drops liquor bismuth onehalf \\nounce Water to make three ounces \\n\\nBOILS â€” \\n\\nThese are similar to the boils in human beings and are due to the \\nsame causes that is they indicate either a poverty of the system and a gen \\neral weakness or they may be the result of plethora and too much blood \\n\\nThey also follow diseases like distemper and are not uncommonly induced \\nby worms Boils are very painful and make the dog cross They appear \\nusually where the skin is thinnest Their first appearance is in the form \\nof small red swellings which enlarge become hot and painful and even \\ntually break and discharge their contents They usually appear on the \\ninside of the thighs and bellies of young puppies when suffering with dis \\ntemper or worms If accompanying distemper they should not be treated \\nbut at other times the proper thing to do is to reform the diet give more \\ngreen food bathe oftener exercise more and when the boils are soft and \\nripe open them with a sharp knife and dress with an antiseptic solution \\n\\nBlood Poverty of the â€” See Anaemia \\n\\nBites â€” A great injustice is done to a great many dogs by the old say \\ning that dogs delight to bark and bite for there are very many that do \\nnot delight in either but are to the contrary properly behaved dogs in this \\nrespect Some clogs do however but generally in self defense or at sup \\nposed call of duty Should your dog get bitten wash the wound with tepid \\nwater press out any blood and pour a little of friars balsam or compound \\ntincture of myrh on it \\n\\nSince the above was written I was bitten on the left hand in fourteen \\nplaces by a Bulldog I was showing in the ring at the 1916 dog show at \\nLouisville Ky State Fair really the worst chewing up I ever got Was \\ntaken to the hospital near the dog show The doctor washed the hand \\nthen dressed it with tincture of Iodine and then applied a healing salve \\ncalled Unguentine to be had at any drug store repeating this daily \\nwhile show lasted and I done the same for a week after home The hand \\nwrapped with cotton and bandage and the result was my hand got entirely \\nwell I will just mention however that the poor dog after home as at \\nthe show where for some cause he suddenly went off his base continued \\nhere to be crazy did not try again to bite me we were friends but \\ndid bite every dog he got at here and suddenly died three days later \\nbeing buried by me in my back yard under an apple tree â€” and I miss \\npoor Wrinks I find that many doctors now use tincture of Iodine \\nthe first thing on a bite or wound in place of cauterizing and I strongly \\nadvise doing so and then the salve The first thing to do if you are \\nbitten is to suck the bite if on any part of your body you can get at with \\nyour mouth and spit this out which abstracts any poison â€” if any poison \\nfrom the bite Dont be afraid of a dogs bite dont get scared the only \\ndanger is a small percentage of blood poison setting in but if your own \\nblood is in good condition there is no danger Wrinks case with almost \\nevery veterinarian would have been a sure case of rabies but as I dont \\nbelieve in this I am yet here writing this article \\n\\nInstead of cauterizing a bite which always makes a nasty looking \\nwound I much prefer to use the tincture of Iodine using a small brush \\nor if this is not on hand then apply Peroxyde of Hydrogen which will \\ndo all the cauterizing will do \\n\\nShould your dog be bitten by a strange dog and any suspicion exists of \\nsocalled rabies in the strange dog immediately use the tincture of Iron \\n\\n\\nor Peroxyde of Hydrogen and isolate the dog until the time has passed \\nfor any fear of hydrophobia developing This advice is given to those \\nwho believe in the sotermed hydrophobia and you are referred now to \\nRabies where I give fully my own belief on this subject as well as the \\nideas of others In case there is a tear it may be necessary to bandage \\nor draw together with a few stitches of silk thread \\n\\nBowels Inflammation of Enteritis Peritonitis â€” This is so ably \\ntreated by Dalziel and by experience I know it to be good that I here re \\nproduce his article in full The best plan however is to at once send for \\na veterinarian providing you have one who understands or has made a \\nspecialty of treating dogs â€” anyhow get the best one in your locality and \\ndont stop to think of what it will cost for you owe it to your dog to help \\nhim out of his trouble if such a thing is possible \\n\\nThe severity and very dangerous charcter of this disease in the dog \\nis such that perhaps the very best advice that can be given to the amateur \\nwho finds his valuable dog attacked by it is send for a qualified veterinary \\nsurgeon without delay The owner may however he possessed of sufficient \\nselfconfidence as to wish to try his own skill in treating the disease or \\nthe animal may not be considered of sufficient value to incure the expense \\nof employing a professional man although there may be every desire to \\nsave the animals life and if I can help in any such commendable endeavor \\nwithout encouraging useless and ignorant experiments at the cost of torture \\nto the dog I shall feel that I have been of some little service Whatever \\ncourse is determined on whether home treatment or the calling in of pro \\nfessional aid the decision should not be taken till the symptoms have been \\ncarefully and minutely observed and the greatest attention must be paid \\nto them else there is every fear of the amateur confounding it with and \\ntreating it as colic a disease which although strongly resembling inflamma \\ntion in some of its symptoms differs widely in others and requires totally \\ndifferent treatment Colic if neglected or if wrongly treated may and \\nfrequently does end in inflammation but it is in itself a distinct ailment \\nand the same remark equally applies to constipation or obstruction of the \\nbowels As inflammation of the bowels or enteritis is one of the most fatal \\ndiseases to which the dog is liable â€” frequently carrying him off very quick \\nlyâ€” no half measures will do for it but having ascertained clearly from \\nthe prevailing symptoms that the disease is actually present remedial meas \\nures must be adopted with promptitude and energy The main causes of the \\ndisease are irregular or improper diet or it may be irritation caused by the \\ndog having swallowed some hard indegestible substance exposure to cold \\nand wet may produce it and it is sometimes the result of illusage such as \\na kick \\n\\nInflamation of the bowels may be distinguished from colic in being \\nmore gradual in its approach and is always ushered in by general feverish \\nness the nose is hot and dry the eyes red and inflamed and the whole \\ncountenance is expressive of great anxiety shivering fits occur the belly is \\nhard and distended and in the surface hot to the touch the urine is gener \\nally scanty and high colored As in colic when standing the back is arched \\nthe feet are drawn in toward each other and the tail is tightly tucked be \\n\\ntween the legs or the clog may steal into a quiet corner stretch his legs \\nout before and behind and crouch with his belly on the ground probably \\nfinding temporary relief by bringing it in contact with the cold floor or \\nground the dOg may at the same time be observed to frequently turn an \\nanxious face toward his flanks \\n\\nAnother safe and pretty certain way of distinguishing between enteri \\ntis and simple obstruction or colic is by pressing the hand along the belly \\nin the latter disease especially colic the rubbing gives relief whereas in \\ninflammation it evidently causes acute pain the cry of pain given by the \\ndog in this disease is shorter and sharper than the rather prolonged howl \\nin colic but to distinguish by this symptom would require finer discrimi \\nnation than can be reasonably expected from the comparatively inexper \\nienced for whom I presume to write I may here mention the fact that \\nenteritis is very commonly a complication of that scorge of the kennel \\ndistemper and this fact alone sufficiently shows the folly of trusting to \\nany single medicine pill powder potion or any socalled specific whatever \\nfor the cure of that disease The treatment proper in the disease under \\nconsideration consists in getting the bowels relieved as speedily as possi \\nble by the mildest means that can be used constipation being generally \\npresent for this purpose the use of clysters every fifteen minutes as recom \\nmended in obstruction of the bowels should be resorted to and the in \\njections must be used gently and with as little fuss and annoyance to the \\npatient as possible When the clysters begin to take effect the evacuation \\nof the bowels should be assisted by a dose of castor oil From six to \\ntwelve leeches according to the size and strength of the dog should be \\napplied to the belly and after they have filled themselves the bleeding \\nfrom the bites may be encouraged by bathing the whole surrounding parts \\nfreely and continuously with warm water Many of the best writers on \\ndogs recommend giving calomel and opium combined and it may appear \\npresumptuous in me to offer a contrary opinion but experientia docet I \\nhave given calomel to dogs in this disease and many others but I do not \\nthink I ever once gave it without making the patient worse so I have \\nlong discarded it in the firm belief that it is not a medicine at all suited \\nto the dog and I am quite certain from my own experience and feel sure \\nthe best veterinarians will bear me out that the abusive use of calomel \\nand other forms of mercury given too often in immense and poisonous \\ndoses to the dog by country farriers and others ignorant of its properties \\nand who work by the rule of thumb is not infrequently the cause of \\ninflammation of the bowels Instead of calomel I have in several cases \\nused the following with excellent effect \\n\\nTake true James Powder 3 grains \\n\\nPowdered Opium 14 grain \\n\\nIn one ppwder Give every two hours till three are given large \\nsized dogs require double that dose \\n\\nIf happily the dog gets over the attack with signs of returning health \\ngreat weakness will be evident and this must be met by good nursing and \\na generous but easily assimilated diet Beef tea thickened with bread \\n\\n\\nrice etc will answer well The diet must be so varied as to keep the \\nbowels open without the use of medicine \\n\\nWhen well on the road to health great progress will be accelerated by \\ngiving Eberharts Tonic Pills for twenty to thirty days They contain no \\ndope unlike many others make the dog eat and get him back to \\nhealth flesh and spirits \\n\\nTo allay the pain give 5 gr to 10 gr of chloral with 5 to 30 drops \\nof tincture of opium also apply hot flannels to the abdomen \\n\\nThe following treatise on this trouble was written especially for this \\nbook by Dent and I consider it also very valuable \\n\\nAn affection of the small intestines This disease is of the most \\ndangerous character and unfortunately prevalent It will carry off a dog \\nin a few hours and in its treatment there is always danger of its being \\nconfounded with common colic which is as a rule not fatal The diseases \\ncan be distinguished from each other as follows \\n\\nColic comes on quickly and is relieved by rubbing the stomach â€” the \\npain is more intense and spasmodic \\n\\nEnteritis comes on more slowly with greater general depression the \\npain is continuous and is increased by rubbing the stomach \\n\\nCauses â€” The common cause of inflammation of the small intestines \\nis the feeding of an improper diet the indigestible substances setting up \\nan irritation that inflames the delicate lining of the bowels Cold ex \\nposure wet blows kicks or anything that will injure the small intestines \\nThe parts affected in this disease are also causes This disease is also a \\ncommon complication of distemper \\n\\nSymptoms â€” This disease is always ushered in by feverishness the \\neyes are red and swollen nose hot and dry mouth sticky the belly is hard \\ntense and hot to the touch the patient has frequent shivering fits and the \\ncountenance is most expressive of pain and anxiety The animal will steal \\naway into some corner and stretch itself out on the floor so as to bring \\nthe belly next to the cool floor or ground and in this way may be relieved \\nturning his head every few moments and look at its flanks When stand \\ning the tail is tucked between its legs all four feet are drawn in toward \\neach other and the back is arched \\n\\nTreatment â€” Warm comfortable quarters are of the first importance \\nand a thick woolen jacket carefully padded and adjusted over the belly \\nchest and flanks will protect the parts and give relief In all stages of \\nthe disease it is of the utmost importance that the bowels be relieved of \\ntheir irritating contents \\n\\nGive injections of lukewarm water and castile soap â€” or thin oatmeal \\nwater containing one ounce of glycerine â€” until the lower bowels are emp \\ntied \\n\\nThen give a dose of olive oil and castor oil in equal parts to which \\ncan be added from 10 to 20 drops of laudanum for each ounce of the oils \\nso as to relieve the pain \\n\\nOne ounce of this combination of oils can be given as a dose to a 40lb \\ndog Smaller dogs less in proportion to size \\n\\nAfter the bowels have been opened to further allay the pain give to a \\n40lb dog from 5 to 10 grains of chloral with from 5 to 30 drops of the \\ntincture of opium as often as necessary The diet and feeding must be \\ncarefully looked to The food must be soft semiliquid bland and unir \\nritating fed only a small quantity at a time and three grains of pepsin \\ngiven after each meal \\n\\nDrink must be allowed only in very small quantities Milk with the \\naddition of lime water is excellent If there is a tendency to vomit give the \\nsubnitrate of bismuth in 5 to 10 grain doses three times a day When \\nthe dog begins to recover from the disease the proportion of solid food \\ncan be increased and a good tonic condition pill will facilitate convales \\ncence and build up the patient \\n\\nEberharts tonic pills or Claytons or Sergeants condition pills would \\nnew be of great benefit used for a few weeks \\n\\nBack Stiffness Usually the result of old age chronic rheumatism or \\n\\nlumbago but sometimes the result of sprains a blow or other injury such as \\nbt ing run over across the back The patient in most cases walks with \\ndifficulty or may start out all right and in the best of spirits but before \\ngoing far begins to lag loses its spirits and drops its tail In most cases \\nthere is pain evidenced upon pressure being applied to the back In \\nother cases the patent can walk very well but is unable to jump Treat \\nment consists of absolute rest and the use of a good liniment the follow \\ning being recommended Tincture of hyoscyamus onehalf ounce chloroform \\nonehalf ounce spirits of camphor one ounce soap liniment one ounce \\nThe parts should be massaged and this liniment applied with gentle friction \\ntwice a day It is also advisable to give a dose of aperient medicine and \\ntu feed on a light diet \\n\\nBad Breath â€” This disgusting condition is due to a variety of causes \\nchief among them being a disordered stomach the result of worms or in \\ndigestion and a diseased condition of the teeth which is more or less \\ndependent upon the condition of the stomach Diseases of the lungs as \\nwell as a catarrhal condition of the nasal passages also affect the breath \\nRemove the cause that is if the stomach is out of order treat for worms \\nand use a good

occurrence and consists \\nof a purulent discharge from the prepuce In treating the general health \\nshould be given attention and the diet carefully regulated Cleanliness of \\nsurroundings is also important Feed good dog cakes with milk and little \\nor no meat Internally give Fowlers solution of arsenic in doses of from \\n\\n\\ntwo to fifteen drops three times a day after feeding Cleanse the parts \\nwith tepid water which should he injected into the prepuce with a syringe \\nand then syringe out the prepuce with a solution of nitrate of silver one \\ngrain to the ounce of water or use a

for life and if severe often gives a violent shock \\nto the system and symptoms of illness arising from it should be observed \\nand treated according to circumstances Apply the above oil direct to \\nthe wound alone and at once cover thickly with cotton wool to exclude \\nthe air from the bladders formed On removing the dressing prick the \\nbladders with a needle smooth them down gently reapply the dressing \\ntaking care that no hairs are left on the sore places \\n\\nBurns â€” May be due to contact with fire but more frequently it is \\nboiling water that has caused the injury In some cases the skin is \\nscorched and the hair frizzled but the hair roots are not destroyed and a \\nnew growth soon reappears In other cases the tissues of the skin are \\ndestroyed the hair roots killed and a large blister forms which usually \\ngoes through a stage of suppuration and then heals leaving a smooth \\nwhite glistening scar on which the hair never grows If the skin is only \\nscorched apply three or four times a day the common lime water and linseed \\noil lotion composed of one part of lime water to two parts of linseed oil \\nThis relieves the pain protects the parts from the air and in a few days \\nthe patient is all right In those cases where the skin has been burned \\ndeeply the parts should be coated with boracic ointment After the \\nblister breaks there is nothing better than boracic ointment to apply to \\nthe raw surfaces It should be laid on thickly and protected by lint or \\nabsorbent cotton kept in place by a bandage The dressing should be

swelling of the tongue along \\nthe sides and underneath It comes on suddenly is most frequent in spring \\nand summer and appears to be epidemic many cases occurring in the \\nsame neighborhood at the same time it has not been shown to be contagious \\nand although it is not a fatal disease it is a very troublesome one \\n\\nThe symptoms appear without warning and apparently without cause \\nThe first thing generally observed is a considerable increase in the flow \\nof saliva which dribbles from the mouth The breath is foetid and on \\nexamination the tongue will be found considerably swollen while if the \\ndisease has lasted any time there will be observed large livid vesicles which \\nrupture leaving ulcers these ultimately assume a gangrenous form and \\ndischarge foetid matter tinged with blood \\n\\nThe above description of Blain malignant sore mouth I quote from \\nDalziel \\n\\nI have never had a case of this trouble which is not often found in \\ndogs The following was written on this trouble by Dr C L Thulichum \\nfor Forest and Stream and it is through their courtesy that I publish it \\n\\nCauses of this trouble are conjectural the disease is most prevalent \\nin the spring and summer and more frequently found in the southern than \\nin the northern latitudes I do not know of any authority who assigns any \\nparticular cause for this trouble and although I can not say with any \\ncertainty myself I have however noted the following conditions \\nand they may be supposable causes but I do not wish to go on record \\nas asserting that they are the actual causes as they are simply deductions \\nof my own \\n\\nI was located in the South in practice some years ago when I first \\nsaw a case of this trouble in the dog At that time I had on my hands \\nseveral cases of anthrax or Texas fever in cattle I noted that whenever \\nI found a case of this trouble in the dog I could also by inquiry find that \\nin the neighborhood some one had not long before lost a cow from the cow \\ndisease as they called it As the dogs were allowed in that section to \\nrun at large and as a dog is when at large more or less of a scavenger I \\nconcluded that either the dog affected had found the carcass of the cow \\nthat had died and been buried and dug himself up a meal from her or \\nthat following that very desirable habit that most dogs are possessed of \\nrolling in carrion he had taken a roll in this filth and then in licking him \\nself afterward had thus infected his mouth with the disease This as \\nsumption may be entirely wrong but I give it for what it is worth and it \\nis the most common sense cause that I can give for the disease in the section \\nin which I met it The English authorities do not assign any cause simply \\nsaying that the attack often begins without any apparent or previous illness \\nwhich is so the attack is apparently sudden your dog seems well today \\nand tomorrow has a very sore mouth \\n\\nSymptoms â€” Dog may be a little listless for a day or two which may \\nnot be noticed Next and noticeable symptom is that he wants to drink a \\n\\n\\ngreat deal of water and drools saliva from the corners of the mouth \\ntongue is enlarged and thickened You look into the mouth and find it \\ncovered on its sides and under surface with large vesicles of a red or livid \\ncolor which may end in irregular and even gangrenous ulcers the breath \\nis extremely offensive and discharge of salvia very great dog will not eat \\nand apparently can not swallow but this is a mistake â€” he can but wont \\nowing to the great soreness of the mouth If the disease is not checked \\nnow it passes on to the bowels and the dog dies with severe bloody dis \\ncharges \\n\\nTreatment â€” There is only one that I have ever found necessary and if \\nyou get at the dog promptly before the bowel trouble commences I believe \\nyou will affect a cure in every case at least I have \\n\\nGet an ounce of the tincture of sanquinaria canadensis at your drug \\ngists and a camels hair throat pencil or swab on wire Paint the inside of \\nthe mouth and tongue where affected with this morning and night and \\ngive a tablet of bichloride of mercury onehundredth of a grain three \\ntimes a day internally Feed nothing but milk for several days after \\ncure is effected Buttermilk is one of the finest adjuncts to a cure You \\nwatch the dog closely and dont give him too much water not until he \\nsuffers from the lack of it but so that he will be thirsty enough to drink the \\nbuttermilk when you hand it to him Have it as cold as possible and give \\nhim a soup plate full three times a day one day sweet milk the next but \\ntermilk After he is well feed him for some time boiled rice and milk and \\nbuttermilk and bring him gradually on to his regular feed \\n\\nThe above treatment I have found to put the mouth in such shape \\nthat the dog will take nourishment after the first twentyfour hours and \\nafter that he will steadily improve and four or five days sees the mouth \\nentirely healed except that it is still tender to solid food To a dog the \\nsize of a setter or hound you can give as high as a fiftieth of a grain at a \\ndose of the bichloride of mercury to pups and smaller breeds onehun \\ndredth of a grain is enough and in fact I confine myself to this dose with \\nall sized dogs under St Bernards or mastiffs as it is quite as effective in \\nthe smaller dose as in the larger \\n\\nBrain Inflammation of the Meningitis â€” The meingess the mem \\nbranes enveloping the brain are liable to inflammation Symptoms are \\ngreat drowsiness with sudden spasmodic movements of the muscles of the \\nhead and chest during sleep The disease is often produced by fits In this \\nand other brain

\\nthin mattery fluid which forms a scab matting the hair together which \\nin a few days falls off leaving bare patches moist from the exuded fluid \\nThese will appear in a night and need cause no

the discharge from the nose becoming thick and copious and \\nthe dog suffers from violent sneezing \\n\\nTreatment â€” Put the dog in a room tolerably warm one with a fire in \\nit is best where a teakettle is kept boiling as the steam thus distributed \\nthroughout the room is very beneficial but ventilation is also essential \\nA room with a fireplace in it would insure this Give the dog one dose \\nof from three to five grains of true James Powder As a mild laxative \\ngive a dose of castor oil For food give broths or porridge with bits of \\nboiled liver added \\n\\nWhere there is an accumulation of phlegm and the animal endeavors \\nto dislodge it dive a dessertspoonful to a tablespoonful of ipecacuanha \\nwine to act as an emetic This will greatly relieve the patient If the

the \\nbreathing short and thick and the dog is incapable of much exertion \\nChronic cases are incurable but alleviation can be given when it is unusually \\nbad by giving a desertspoonful to a tablespoonful according to size of dog \\nof equal parts of oxymel of squills and thick mucilage of acacia several \\ntimes a day \\n\\nAnother veterinarian advises as follows \\n\\nThis trouble is of frequent occurrence and is due to an inflammation \\nof the air passage leading down into the body of the lung and may be the \\nresult of a cold or chill or the breathing of smoke or novious vapors The \\nsymptoms are more or less difficulty in breathing severe and constant \\ncoughing and the accumulation of phlegm in the windpipe In bad cases \\nthe patient will not lie down but sits with the forelegs braced and the \\nchest expanded In treating place in a room comfortably warm without \\nbeing overheated and moisten the air by keeping a kettle going If the \\nthroat is so full of phlegm that breathing is difficult give an emetic of the \\nwine of ipecac in doses of a half to two teaspoonfuls repeated in one \\nhour if necessary After the stomach is erupted and the patient has quieted \\nuse the following mixture Paragoric six drams Hoffmans spirits two \\ndrams ipecacuanha wine one dram syrum of squills one ounce water to \\nmake three ounces The dose is a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful every \\nfour or six hours Keep the bowels open by occasional doses of aperient \\nmedicine and repeat the emetic if the breathing has not improved in forty \\neight hours and after the acute stage of the disease has passed and the \\ncough is better give cod liver oil emulsion Feed on milk meat broths and \\nsoup during the early stages of the disease and as the severe symptoms \\nabate meat may be given \\n\\nBronchitis Chronic Husk This condition is the result of a more \\n\\nor less chronic thickening of the membranes lining the air passages so that \\nthe dog is in apparent good health with the exception of a hard dry husky \\ncough that is brought on by any excitement or exertion and is usually \\nworse in the morning and at night These attacks of coughing end usually \\n\\n\\nin a retching and gagging as if vomiting or expelling a piece of phlegm \\nfrom the throat Give aperient medicine so as to keep the bowels open \\nand use the following mixture Tincture of nux vomica thirty drops syrup \\nof squills one ounce water to make three ounces dose from half a tea \\nspoonful to a tablespoonful three times a day after feeding the first for \\na toy the second for a St Bernard or one of the larger breeds If the \\ncough is very severe give from fifteen drops to a teaspoonful of glyco \\nheroin in water Feed underdone meat raw eggs gelatine or any easily \\ndigested food that will not distend the stomach unduly as a distension of \\nthe stomach brings pressure on the chest and aggravates the condition \\n\\nBowels Intussusception â€” This trouble is of more frequent occur \\nrence in puppies than old dogs It is the result of the bowel telescoping \\nupon itself By careful manipulation of the abdomen it can be located by \\na long hard swelling The patient suffers much pain and usually whines \\nand cries pitifully The other symptoms are diarrhea with bloodtinged \\nmucus and in the early stages vomiting Intussusception is due to a variety \\nof causes such as worms indigestion and colic or the eating of hard \\nsubstances but as indigestion colic and the abnormal appetite that causes \\ndogs to eat indigestible and irritating matter are more or less the result \\nof the presence of worms the latter must be accepted as the primary \\ncause The importance of treating for them frequently is therefore ap \\nparent In treating mild cases that have not progressed far give from \\none to five drops of laudanum every three hours in a teaspoonful of milk \\nOne drop is the correct dose for a puppy two to three months old of the \\ntoy breeds and five drops is the dose for the large breeds of the age men \\ntioned Feed only liquid food â€” milk or beef tea If there is not a decided \\nimprovement in the puppys condition in twentyfour hours an operation \\nshould be resorted to In the early stages it is nearly always successful \\nand the puppy receives immediate relief If it is postponed the operation \\nis more difficult on account of the inflammation and the bowels cannot \\nbe so easily straightened The patient should fast for twentyfour hours \\nfollowing the operation after which for a few days administer only liquids \\n\\nBreasts Inflammation â€” This painful condition usually attacks bitches \\nwhile nursing their puppies the abscesses that are liable to form at other \\ntimes being generally of slower growth and not accompanied by systemic \\ndisturbance The milk gland in acute cases is swollen hard and red and \\nvery painful and the elevation of temperature indicates the formation of \\npus After two or three days the swelling becomes softer comes to a \\npoint breaks and freely discharges If the bitch is nursing it is necessary \\nusually to remove the puppies and feed them by hand or turn them \\nover to a fostermother the mother meanwhile being milked two or three \\ntimes a day The swellings should be poulticed with flaxseed until they \\nare soft and then lanced As a rule they do not require any other treat \\nment for their dependent position insures free drainage It is advisable \\nto keep the patients bowels open with a dose of aperient medicine \\n\\nBiliousness â€” Symptoms are vomiting in the morning of frothy yellow \\n\\nbile usually after eating grass an unusual thirst sometimes a diarrhoea \\nrefusal of food and in some cases the eyes and mouth and skin take on \\na yellow cast For treatment first give a dose of castor oil so as to keep \\nthe bowels open and remove the excess of bile If there is much nausea \\nand sickness of the stomach give carbonate of bismuth A dose of from \\ntwo to twelve grains simply should be placed on the tongue and the mouth \\nheld for a moment until it is swallowed If this does not give good results \\nuse the following prescription Diluted hydrocyanic acid twenty drops \\nliquor bismuth one ounce water to make six ounces The dose is from \\na teaspoonful to a tablespoonful every three hours In most of these \\ncases giving the stomach a complete rest will do more good than anything \\nin the way of drugs In some cases good results follow the use of small \\ndoses of quinine or the extract of taraxacum \\n\\nBed Sores Large unhealthylooking sores frequently form on the \\n\\nhips points of the buttocks shoulders and other parts of dogs which have \\nsuffered from severe illness Success in treatment depends upon protect \\ning the parts affected from further injury First clean the parts with a \\nwarm saturated solution of boracic acid then dry carefully with soft linen \\nrags and dust with powdered boracic acid and iodoform in equal parts \\nencircle the injured parts with a ring of felt kept in position with adhesive \\ntape \\n\\nBladder irritable â€” These cases as a rule require the attention of \\na veterinary as the irritation may be set up by a variety of causes not \\nthe least of which is a stone in the bladder The common symptom of \\nbladder trouble is constant straining even when indoors in other cases \\nnot so bad there is frequent micturition of highcolored cloudy strong \\nsmelling urine The presence of blood as a rule is an indication of calcu \\nlus or stone Sometimes the blood comes mixed with the urine and in \\nother cases it comes in drops after the passing of water In those cases \\nwhere the stone becomes fixed in the pasage and the dog is incapable of \\nmicturition no time should be lost in calling in a good veterinary sur \\ngeon If there is not much pain a course of treatment with the hyposul \\nphite of soda is all that is necessary the dose being from three to twenty \\ngrains diluted in water and administered three times a day before feeding \\nIf there is much pain give the tincture of hyoscyamus in dose of from \\ntwo to fifteen drops in water every three hours Feed on milk barley wa \\nter and dog cakes \\n\\nBroken Bones â€” It can be ascertained that a bone of the leg is broken \\nby taking hold of the limb above the supposed fracture and moving the \\nlower portion against it when a grating or crackling of the broken ends \\nagainst each other will be felt or heard The treatment consists in ad \\njusting the fractured parts to their natural form and applying splints to \\nkeep the parts set Splints may be made of strips of gutta percha softened \\nin warm water and moulded to fit the limb or pieces of thin wood may be \\ncut the required size and well padded with wadding The splints can be \\nkept in place by binding evenly with light cotton bandages which pre \\n\\n\\nvious to application have been smeared with the following preparation \\nwhilst warm Take Venice turpentine Burgundy pitch equal parts melt \\nand smear over the bandage whilst hot If much swelling occurs it will \\nbe necessary to slacken the bandages and in most cases it will be requisite \\nto muzzle the dog to prevent him tearing off the splints Perfect rest will \\nbe required and the general health attended to The time it will take \\nfor the bones to unite is uncertain but always tedious \\n\\nUnless you feel capable of handling the case properly yourself you had \\nbetter call in a verterinarian or your family physician Your druggist could \\ndo this in case neither the veterinarian or doctor could be had \\n\\nBowels Obstruction of the Constipation or Costiveness â€” Dogs kept \\n\\nin the house and not exercised sufficiently or improperly fed are particularly \\nliable to constipation Bones while excellent and almost necessary to a \\ndogs health yet an excessive use of them is to be avoided also any one \\nkind of dry food and no dog should be kept constantly on one kind of food \\nas want of exercise and the absence of necessary variety in the food are \\nthe principal causes of constipation \\n\\nWhen looked upon as a disease itself or as a symptom and attendant \\non other diseases it is always troublesome and often becomes dangerous \\nThe feces accumulate and get pressed into hardened lumps the belly is \\ndistended and hard the colic pains occur driving the dog almost frantic \\nand causing him to run about blindly stumbling over different obstacles \\nin this way and to give utterance every now and the nto sharp howls of \\npain All this pain and misery that the poor dog has to suffer in nearly \\nevery case is the result of neglect of proper rules which every dog owner \\nshould in common justice to the dog be acquainted with and observe But \\nthe evil does not end here for it is the too common practice to rush into \\none of commission quite as great or greater â€” namely the common practice \\nin constipation of resorting to strong purgatives such as epsom salts jalop \\ncalomel etc the consequence of giving which is to render the evil worse \\nby forcing the feces into still less compass when it becomes more impacked \\nand hardened than before The proper course to follow is when the dog \\nis in great pain administer a dose of the antispasmodic drops Compound \\nspirits of sulphuric ether and tincture of opium laudanum equal parts \\nMix and keep in a wellstoppered bottle in a cool place The dose for a \\n20lb to 30lb dog would be a small teaspoonful given in about two \\ntablespoonfuls of milk gruel or other liquid Success in relieving the pa \\ntient is best obtained by mechanical means Clysters of thin oatmeal gruel \\nor soap and water lukewarm and containing about one ounce of castor \\noil in each half pint must be used continuously for some time in fact till \\nthe desired object has been attained This end will be greatly facili \\ntated by first introducing the finger oiled into the rectum and removing as \\nmuch of the hard lumps of feces as can be reached Assistance will also \\nbe given to the action of the clysters by gently pressing or kneading the \\nbelly at intervals with the hand It is necessary that everything should \\nbe done with the greatest gentleness boisterous conduct and rough hand \\nling being likely to alarm the patient and cause him to do himself irre \\n\\nparable injury When the lower bowels have been emptied follow it \\nup by giving the dog a strong dose of Podophyllin pills \\n\\nPodolphylln 6 grains \\n\\nCompound extract of colocynth 30 grains \\n\\nPowdered rhubarb 48 grains \\n\\nExtract of henbane 36 grains \\n\\nMix and divide into twentyfour pills The dose is from onehalf to \\ntwo pills according to age and size and it is advisable to give the dog a little \\nwarm broth after the pill to assist in its action \\n\\nThe use of purgatives must not be resorted to to prevent a recurrence \\nof the disease The system of management must be altered the dog must \\nhave daily exercise the food must be varied and embrace a portion of \\nboiled green vegetables at least every second or third day For a week \\nor so after the attack rather sloppy food should be given such as welf \\nboiled porridge and milk or broth and an occasional meal of boiled liver \\nwill act as a gentle laxative \\n\\nWorms are another cause of obstruction in the intestines especially in \\npuppies round worms get coiled into balls set up local irritation and \\ninterfere with the natural action of the bowels \\n\\nBLACK TONGUE â€”\\n\\nThis is a new disease confined so far to dogs in the Southern states \\nPersonally I have never seen a case of it and do not pretend to try to ad \\nvise as to treatment The following was written by the late Polk Miller \\nof Richmond Va and a valued friend of mine he was and I am giving \\nhis article and treatment due to the great confidence I felt in him as a \\ngentleman sportsman and lover of dogs \\n\\nBLACK TONGUE OR THE NEW â€”\\n\\nThere is a new disease among the dogs in our Southern States and in \\nsome of the Northern and Western States though to a limited extent \\nwhich is giving great trouble and anxiety among dogowners I say new \\nbecause it has appeared in the last ten years It is called Black Tongue \\nby the majority of people but as that does not appear in all cases it is \\ncalled the New Disease A dog which is perfectly well today may be \\nextremely ill tomorrow and if the disease is not arrested in twentyfour to \\nthirtysix hours it generally proves fatal A close watch should be kept to \\nsee that it doesnt get too good a start The symptoms as nearly as I \\ncan describe them are as follows General languor dullness about the \\neyes little or no appetite a dryness about the mouth and throat some \\ntimes swelling and high fever In some cases the glands are excited \\nand a profuse flow of saliva is noticed but in most cases the tongue is \\ndry and the poor brute seems anxious though unable to swallow water \\non account of inability to lap the liquid These are some of the most \\nnoticeable symptoms and the dog thus affected is indisposed to notice \\n\\n\\nthe call or caresses of his master and manifests a disposition to roam \\nabout in a listles manner preferring to be severely left alone What \\never may be the opinion of others as to a proper treatment or a name for \\nthis disease it is my belief from personal experience with it that it \\nshould be treated in the same manner as our old physicians treated diph \\ntheria in human beings before the new remedy â€” antitoxin â€” was discov \\nered I give that and trust that the lives of many dogs that would other \\nwise die may be saved I have never failed to cure a dog by the prompt use \\nof this treatment at the very first appearance of the trouble and I have \\nnever known one to get well when two days have elapsed before the rem \\nedy was applied \\n\\nChlorate of Potassium V2 ounce \\n\\nMur Tine Iron Vz ounce \\n\\nWater 1 pint \\n\\nSig â€” Mix shake and with a soft rag protruding over the end of a \\nstick dip into the solution and thoroughly mop out the mouth and throat \\ntwice daily for two days \\n\\nThe following was written by someone south who seemed to know \\nfrom experience as to Black Tongue The 3 grain dose given of thymol was \\nused on a Foxhound probably a fifty pound dog therefore exercise judg \\nment as thymol is a dangerous drug for smaller dogs \\n\\nAs to black tongue I use the thymol as it is a better antiseptic \\nfor the intestinal tract and in addition to this I use alternately a wash of \\npermanganate of potash and a saturated watery solution of alum I give \\nthe thymal rubbed up with pure Castile soap and put into capsules giving \\none capsule containing three grains of thymol every four hours I wash the \\nmouth out before each capsule is given alternating with the two solutions \\nmentioned above \\n\\nAs the dog sick with black tongue will not eat as a rule I drench \\nhim with milk morning and night sometimes adding a raw egg to the \\nmilk \\n\\nI want to give just a few warnings to those unfamiliar with the use \\nof thymol Its use in the human being is attended with a certain amount of \\ndanger and this is doubly so in the dog It should never be given to a \\ndog until the intestinal tract has been thoroughly cleaned out with salts \\nThe dog should then be starved for at least twelve hours before the thy \\nmol is administered and this should be followed in six hours with another \\ndose of salts The dog should then be given nothing to eat for several \\nhours more Under no circumstances should the dog be allowed any \\nfat for several hours after the last dose of salts and he should have \\nnothing whatever to eat between the first and last dose of salts \\n\\nSeveral fatal cases of poisoning are on record from the use of thymol \\nin the treatment of hookworm in the human Chenopodium or the oil of \\nwormseed is a far safer drug to use In addition to its being a safer \\ndrug it has been proven that it effects cures of hookworm in the human \\nwhere thymol has been given and has failed In the Journal of the Amer \\nican Medical Association of November 28 1914 Dr Robert L Levy of \\n\\nJohns Hopkins Hospital reports two cases of hookworm treated and cured \\nwith oil of wormseed where thymol had failed He also gives the coeffi \\ncient of efficacy in the same percentage as the article you have quoted \\nHe gives the following mode of administration First dayâ€” Liquid diet \\n8 p m one ounce Epsom salts Second day â€” Omit breakfast and lunch \\nat 5 a m one ounce of Epsom salts at 7 9 and 11 sixteen drops of oil \\nchenopodium on a little granulated sugar 1 p m one ounce castor oil \\ncontaining fifty minims of chloroform soft supper this for a dog would \\nbe a little bakers bread soaked in milk Third day â€” Resume full diet \\n\\nAnother southern writer has this to say \\n\\nWhile it has not been definitely determined whether or not this dis \\nease is due to hookworm infestment indications suggest a very close relation \\nas postmortem examinations have shown hookworms and great intestinal \\ninflammation Ii is probable that the toxin which the hookworm injects \\ninto the dogs blood may cause the disease It is not contagious nor \\ncan it be communicated by feeding or drinking from the same vessel An \\nexperiment was recently made by feeding parts of stomach and intestines \\nof a dog which died of an acute case of black tongue to several healthy \\ndogs and no ill effects developed Another fact that is quite apparent is \\nthat black tongue is never found except in sections of the country which \\nincludes the entire South where the hookworm is known to exist As to \\nthe treatment for hookworms see Hookworms in the regular worm \\narticle \\n\\nColic â€” This subject is very completely covered by Dalziel \\n\\nNearly all domestic animals are subject to attacks of colic or pripes \\nas it is more frequently termed especially when the horse is the subject \\nof the disease In the dog puppies are especially liable to it but it attacks \\ndogs of all ages and if not promptly attended to and properly treated is \\nvery liable to end in inflammation of the bowels â€” a most dangerous dis \\nease which in some of its features though happily not its dangerous ones \\ncolic resembles One very important point of distinction is that whereas \\ninflammation comes on gradually and feverishness with hot dry nose etc \\nalways exist as premonitory symptoms colic comes on suddenly and a dog \\neating well and seeming in perfect health is seized with spasm of the \\ncoat of the bowels causing such pain that he gives voice to a low moan \\nwhich is afterward changed to a prolonged howl as the paroxysms of pain \\nincrease in frequency and severity In colic too the nose and mouth are \\ncool and there is no offensive breath As in inflammation the attitude \\nis peculiar and unmistakable the back ebing arched the feet drawn in \\ntoward each other and the tail tightly tucked between his legs in colic \\nthe belly is sometimes distended considerably with gas and is then known \\nas flatulent colic It is a disease of frequent occurrence in dogs and the \\nexciting causes are various exposure to wet and cold getting dogs espe \\ncially house dogs to swin in cold inclement weather are common causes \\nthe presence of worms in the intestines also produces colic But the most \\ncommon cause is undoubtedly the giving of improper food sugar and \\n\\n\\nother sweet things are likely to produce it puppies just after weaning \\nare very liable to it especially if they have small lumps of meat or other \\nsolid food thrown to them which they can not well chew but greedily \\nbolt or having a portion of one meal left in the dish till the next meal \\nis added is very likely to produce it because the stale portion undergoes \\nfermentation that is becames sour and the fermentation is carried on in \\nthe stomach Colic is sure to yield to prompt and proper measures and \\nthe treatment is simple and safe As soon as observed give the sufferer \\na dose of antispasmodic drops Compound spirits of sulphuric ether \\nknown as Hoffmans anodyne and tincture of opium laudanum equal \\nparts Mix and keep in a well stoppered bottle in a cool place Dose for \\n15lb to 35lb dog would be a small teaspoonful in two teaspoonfuls of milk \\nor gruel It must be given diluted with thin gruel milk or water \\nand if immediate relief does not follow administer a double quanitity as \\na clyster in gruel or the dose may be repeated in half an hour In flatulent \\ncolic known by the distended belly sounding like a drum when tapped with \\nthe end of the finger from 10 to 30 drops of spirit of sal volatile may be \\nadvantageously added to dose of antispasmodic drops or the following \\ndraught may be given and repeated in an hour if the dog is not relieved \\n\\nCarbonate of soda 20 grains \\n\\nAromatic spirits of ammonia 30 drops \\n\\nEssence of ginger 5 drops \\n\\nLaudanum 15 drops \\n\\nPeppermint water 2 tablespoonfuls \\n\\nThis is a dose for a mediumsized dog such as a pointer or a greyhound \\nFor puppies and smaller breeds use less of this as the dose After the attack \\nhas subsided give the dog a gentle aperient such as the mild purge \\n\\nSyrup of buckthorn 3 parts \\n\\nSyrup of white poppies 1 part \\n\\nCastor oil 2 parts \\n\\nDose for dog 15lb to 30lb is a tablespoonful Bottle must be well \\nshaken before using Larger dogs a little more \\n\\nKeep on a laxative diet and do not let the dog have violent exercise \\nfor a day or so Endeavor to discover the cause of the attack and avoid a \\nrepetition Lead poisoning produces a peculiar form of colic and clogs \\nshould not have water to drink that has been collected in leaden cisterns \\n\\nThe using of oneeighth grain doses of morphine hypodermically every \\nhalf hour or hour during the attack of colic will give relief very soon \\n\\nOoryza is the name given to a common cold when confined to the nose \\nand eyes and a running at the nose and watery eyes I have found the \\nfollowing plan to quickly cure it Take a large sponge wring it out of \\nwarm water sprinkle it freely with vinegar of squills and hold it to the \\nclogs nose so that he inhales the fumes Or half fill an upright jar or jug \\nof suitable size with bran saturate it with hot water and sprinkle over and \\n\\nstir into the bran the following A tablespoonful of ordinary vinegar a \\nteaspoonful of laudanum and six drops of glycerine and carbolic acid \\nBritish Pharmacopoeia Mix and hold the dogs nose over it This \\nquantity is a double handful of bran in a quart or threepint jar is suitable \\nfor a 20 to 50 pound dog A good idea if eyes continue to run would be \\nto use the eye lotion of Hydrastes and Camphor water which you will find \\ngiven under Eye troubles \\n\\nClaws Inflammation at the Roots of â€” Dogs used to the chase or hunt \\ning in scrubby heather or running much over hard uneven roads suffer \\nfrom sre toes the parts around the roots of the claws are swollen in \\nflamed and tender making the dog lame and indeed almost unable to get \\nabout there is redness between the toes and sweating or thin serous \\ndischarge therefrom \\n\\nSuch cases are often very difficult to cure First give a dose of aper \\nient medicine and keep the dog up giving him plenty of soft bedding and \\na light diet Foment the part night and morning with warm water and \\nbathe freely with this lotion Calomel 2 scr lime water 12 oz mix \\nShake the bottle well when using it which should be done four or five times \\na day If the foregoing fail try Goulards Extract of Lead 2 dr tincture \\nof arnica V2 oz distilled water 1 pint mix and apply freely four or five \\ntimes a day If the case is a very bad one wrap the foot in a piece of \\nlint saturated with the lotion and pull over it a chamois leather boot \\nwhich the dog can be prevented from gnawing and pulling off by use of a \\nmuzzle over the mouthpart of which a piece of canvas has been sewn \\n\\nConcussion of the Brain â€” Often occurs in canine practice and is due \\nto accidents In most cases the dog becomes unconscious and the breath \\ning is heavy or usually nearly imperceptible Gradually consciousness re \\nturns but often a stiffness of the limbs and an uncertain gait remains for \\na time The treatment should consist in the administration of stimu \\nlants but great care must be taken not to attempt forcing liquid upon an \\nunconscious animal or choking will be the inevitable result Brandy can be \\ninjected under the skin subcutaneously Ice when procurable should be \\napplied to the head and spinal cord and ammonia to the nostrils If there \\nis a fracture of the skull an operation will become necessary A part of \\nthe bone may be pressing upon the brain when it would have to be raised \\nand so relieve the pressure in which case a vererinarian must be called at \\nonce \\n\\nConstipation â€” Watch your dog every day as to condition of his bowels \\nA dog properly fed and exercised will hardly ever be troubled with consti \\npation I turn my dogs out into their yard each morning and stay there \\na few minutes and watch them Their first inclination is to hunt a place \\nand empty themselves a dogs natural habit If I find one that is con \\nstipated by this I mean unnaturally so where passage is too hard and \\ncrumbles up into dust by putting your foot on it I watch that dog that \\nnight and if still the same it gets a dose of castor oil the next morning \\nunless as sometimes happens the bowels have meanwhile corrected them \\n\\n\\nselves No dog should go over twentyfour hours without a passage and \\nbetter if not so long As to the size of the dose of castor oil this depends \\ngreatly on size and age of dog Take a grown dog the size of a fox terrier \\nor pug by this is meant a dog over a year old and you can give it a table \\nspoonful If this dont work in an hour or so repeat the dose once A \\ndog a year old or over like an English setter could stand two tablespoons \\nful at a dose while the larger breeds like a St Bernard could stand an \\nounce and a half which would be three tablespoonsful or even two ounces \\nat a dose Some dogs like some persons are harder to physic than others \\nso that judgment should be used the idea being not to give too much \\nbut just enough to accomplish the desired result Fluid extract of cascara \\nsagrada is a remedy much used for constipation and to the dose ofcastor \\noil from five to twenty drops of this can be added and given with it with \\nbenefit \\n\\nPuppies from six months to a year old should be given smaller doses \\nin proportion to age and breed of dog \\n\\nYoung puppies as a rule should have rather loose bowels than other \\nwise and are rarely ever troubled with constipation \\n\\nWatch your dogs bowels which is easily done by spending a few min \\nutes each morning after it is let out in the yard Often if only slightly \\nbound up or passage is a bit too hard a little oatmeal same as you cook \\nit for yourself or some cooked liver for its breakfast or a good drink \\nof buttermilk will loosen it up all right in place of the oil If passage \\nis normal shaped and not hard do nothing at all Every dog should \\nempty itself at least twice a clay and puppies oftener \\n\\nSome dogs are troubled with chronic constipation and in such cases \\nuse a laxative pill several of which are made for dogs I have found Clay \\ntons very good \\n\\nCough â€” Cough strictly speaking is a symptom of disease rather than \\na disease itself but it is in very many cases to nonprofessional observation \\nthe most distinct sign that something is wrong indeed so markedly is this \\nthe case that we speak of a person having a bad cough as the ailment from \\nwhich he suffers rather than the symptom of that ailment and hence we \\nhave innumerable specific remedies as cough mixtures cough pills etc \\nOur dog we treat in the same way taking the sign for the substance the \\nsmoke for the fire and fortunately without much practical harm for gen \\nerally speaking the medicine that will ease a cough is acting favorably \\non the disease of which the cough is an evidence To decide what parti \\ncular disease is indicated by the cough the concomitant symptoms and \\ncircumstances as described under the special disease which are usually \\npreceded or accompanied by cough must be taken into account and the \\nspecial treatment called for in each case followed Coughs vary as much \\nin character as do the diseases of which they are in many cases the most \\npronounced indication Thus in common cold the cough slight and humid \\nin bronchitis hard dry and frequent and in inflammation of the lungs \\nand pleurisy short and suppressed doubtless from the great pain caused by \\nthe effort When the throat is sore the cough is hoarse and generally ac \\ncompanied by more or less difficulty in swallowing in asthma the cough \\n\\nmay be described as wheezy and is often followed by vomiting Cough \\nin distemper has a peculiar husky hollow sound Cough may be pro \\nduced by a bit of bone or other substance sticking in the throat and causing \\nirritation in which case the cough is the natural effort to get relief and \\nceases with the removal of the irritating cause As a cough is almost in \\nvariably connected with some derangement of the respiratory organs or \\nair passages its warning should never be neglected and the early resort \\nto the use of the following pills will be sure to relieve will frequently cure \\nand can under no circumstances do any harm \\n\\nCOUGH PILL \\n\\nPowdered ipecacuanha 6 grains \\n\\nPowdered opium 6 grains \\n\\nCompound squill pill 24 grains \\n\\nPowdered gum ammoniacum 2 4 grains \\n\\nPowdered licorice 24 grains \\n\\nPowdered rhubarb 12 grains \\n\\nMix and make into twentyfour pills dose for a 15lb to 40lb dog \\none pill night and morning under 15lbs half a pill and for large \\nbreeds give 1 V2 pills as a dose \\n\\nAnother very good cough mixture for many kinds of coughs is \\n\\nMuriate of ammonia 2

when half a \\nteapoonful will do \\n\\nSpirit chloroform y2 dram \\n\\nWine of ipecac 3 drams \\n\\nTincture of squills 5 drams \\n\\nSimple syrup 1 ounce \\n\\nAqua to make 4 ounces \\n\\nThere are a great many other good cough remedies in fact anything \\ngood for the masters cough is good for the dogs and I herewith give sev \\neral prescriptions that I know to be good by having tried them \\n\\nA dog that is well and in good condition may have a dry cough does \\nnot cough very much at a time but quite often I have cured such cases \\nwith the following \\n\\n\\nCarbonate of aninioniacum 3 drams \\n\\nFluid extract of belladonna 2 drams \\n\\nGum camphor 5 drams \\n\\nSyrup of squills 5 drams \\n\\nSimple syrup 4 ounces \\n\\nFluid extract of licorice 4 ounces \\n\\nDose for a mediumsized dog a teaspoonful every four hours This \\nis a very good cough syrup Large dogs could have 1 y2 teaspoonsf ul \\n\\nA cough remedy advertised for humans called Pinex I tried on dogs \\nand found it to be very good for many coughs You can get a fifty cent \\nbottle of Pinex of your druggist and from this prepare at home a pint \\nof cough syrup that would cost a couple dollars by mixing the contents \\nof the bottle in a syrup you can easily make from less than a pound of \\ngranulated sugar The dose would be from half to a teaspoonful every \\ntwo to four hours Dogs larger than fifty pounds could stand a little \\nlarger dose I have used this for the cough a dog has in distemper and \\nit did the dogs cough good not conflicting with the other medicines \\nbeing used \\n\\nVery lately the following prescription was prescribed for me by a \\nregular doctor for a chronic bronchial dry cough that one of my old \\ndogs has every fall and winter which nothing I had ever used would stop â€” \\nthis one did it â€” and I consider it a most valuable one \\n\\nSyrup Oocillaiia Compound Parke Davis Co â€” Dose would be a \\nteaspoonful for dogs up to 50 pounds and a little more for very large \\nbreeds every two or three hours A dose of any cough syrup should al \\nways be given the last thing at night \\n\\nHere is an old fashioned cough syrup for a sore throat cough \\nBoil down some onions and brown sugar and give teaspoonful every twd \\nor three hours \\n\\nAnother very sensible article on coughs which I found some place \\ncommends itself \\n\\nThere are two kinds of coughs that a dog suffers from one comes \\nfrom the throat and the other from the stomach and each requires dif \\nferent treatment There is about as much use in trying to cure a stomach \\ncough with a bronchial remedy as there would be for you to take a laxa \\ntive for chilblains and yet it is often done The bronchial cold may be \\ntreated in the following manner Put in a warm room and give either cod \\nliver oil syrup of white pine or some similar preparation A good formula \\nfor coughs in dogs is syrup of squills syrup of wild cherry of each two \\nparts glycerine one part If the cough becomes so bad that there is a \\ngreat deal of difficulty in breathing an ordinary water kettle placed over \\na gas stove or some other hot fire so that the escape of steam will be \\nrapid will be found to be a relief Of course a regular bronchitis kettle \\nor one of the patent lamps that can be had for a small sum at any drug \\nstore can also be used In the stomachie cough it is always wise to give \\na purgative and to treat for worms as internal parasites are in nine \\n\\ncases out of ten the primary cause of the trouble Two or three days \\nshould then he allowed to elapse and the treatment repeated This may \\nbe done a third and even a fourth time if the cough does not disappear \\nDo not physic every day or you will weaken the animal too much but allow \\ntwo or three days to pass \\n\\nCuts Tears or Wounds â€” The first thing to be done is to stop the \\nbleeding which can generally be done by simple pressure with the fingers \\nor by a few folds of lint pressed firmly against the cut Unless a consid \\nerable artery has been severed these means are generally successful but if \\nsuch is the case a ligature will be the cure After bleeding is partially or \\nentirely stopped remove all foreign bodies such as glass dirt thorns or \\nsplinters but avoid using very cold or hot water in doing so having it about \\nblood warm If the cut or wound is superficial the cleansing pressing \\nof the parts together and dressing it with friars balsam or tincture of \\nmyrrh applied with a small brush or feather will be all that is required \\nthe using of these tinctures leaving on the wound a protective covering \\nof gum If the lips of the wound will not meet draw them together with \\na few stitches using a slightly curved suture needle and a silk thread \\nwhich should be waxed with beeswax to prevent absorption and its acting \\nas a seaton Sewing up wounds is easy Pass needle through the skin on \\none side of the wound from the outside inward and then through the \\npart of the opposite lip from the inside outward drawing the lips gentlv \\ntogether tie the thread in a double knot and cut ends off close Do each \\nstitch separately If the cut is a long one use a pair of light crossforceps \\nto hold the lips together ahead of where you are sewing as a neater job \\ncan be made in so doing The stitches should be about a half an inch \\napart as a rule It is advisable to muzzle the dog afterwards or keep on a \\nlight bandage to keep the dog from biting off the threads and undoing the \\nstitches with his mouth and tongue The wound heals by adhesion or gran \\nulation matter forming and great attention must now be paid to keeping \\nit clean so as to prevent purification of exuding matter Constantly wash \\naway all discharge sponging freely with \\n\\nPure carbolic acid ounce \\n\\nGlycerine 2 ounces \\n\\nWith water to make a quart Or the antiseptic prescription referred to be \\nlow \\n\\nIn slight cuts in the legs or feet all that is necessary is to wash well \\nand apply friars balsam If severe and requiring bandaging apply a piece of \\nlint under the bandage saturated with a mixture of friars balsam and \\ncamphorated oil \\n\\nThe above is Dalziels idea \\n\\nLately I have in such cases used Peroxyde of Hydrogen or better yet \\napplied tincture of iodine and then to heal it up used the Ungucntine \\nsalve as advised in Bites instead of the above and with best of results \\n\\n\\nEither Dalziels or my own will however do In applying the Peroxyde \\nof Hydrogen just tip the bottle up against the wound for a second when \\nyou will see a white foaming or bubbling discharge come from the sore \\nThis should not be wiped off or allowed to remain on for over a minute \\nor so but removed then by a little water squeezed on it from a sponge or \\ncloth In using the tincture of iodine apply it with a small brush and \\nafter it has dried then rub the Unguentine on once or twice daily A \\ngood idea is to always keep on hand a small vial of tincture of iodine \\nkept tightly corked Judgment must be exercised as to length of time the \\nwound is to be kept open and dischorging the Peroxyde tending to close \\nit up as will the tincture of iodine but use the latter on wound as long \\nas there is any bleeding once a day generally is often enough for this \\n\\nChorea â€” Dalziels treatise and treatment I give in full for it is \\neminently correct judging by my own experience It is a hard disease to \\ncure but I have cured young dogs one or two years old Read what \\nDalziel says and if you have a dog so afflicted at least try to cure it \\nI never admit but what any disease can be cured or helped and I try \\nevery remedy anyhow Sergeants Condition Pills have cured cases in \\nyounger dogs for me and as they always do good and never harm it is \\nworth while trying for you will be doing your dog some good at least \\nThere is not much if any pain in chorea and I had a pug bitch three \\nyears old that had a chronic case of it but yet she bred and raised a \\nhealthy litter of pups This was an exception however as being a ner \\nvous trouble it is transmitable and I would not advise using either a \\nbitch or a dog for breeding purposes that was so afflicted It is of course \\nunpleasant to see a dog constantly twitching or jerking but so long as they \\ndo not suffer I think it my duty to let them live \\n\\nThis most distressing complaint arises from some derangement of \\nthe nervous system and generally exists as a sequence of distemper when \\nIt is known among kennel men as the twitch Chorea or St Vitus dance \\nmay however arise from other causes producing a disturbing effect on the \\nnervous system such as a severe Injury or blow on the head the irrita \\ntion caused by worms or longcontinued Impaired digestion By far the \\nmost common cause however is distemper the brain receiving some in \\njury in that variety of the disease known as Head Distemper The symp \\ntom Indicating chorea is a peculiar Involuntary convulsive twitching of \\nthe muscles These spasmodic movements or jerklngs may be either par \\ntial or general but usually partial One or both hind legs are affected \\nor the twitching extends to the muscles of the fore legs neck and shoul \\nders in which case the head is bobbed up and down in a silly helpless \\nmanner Sometimes the eyelids and muscles of the face are affected but \\nWhatever part of the body is attacked the peculiar twitching or jerking \\nIs always unmistakable When the hind quarters are the seat of the \\ndisease the dog will sometimes suddenly drop one of the limbs from the \\nhip joint apparently from sudden loss of power or command over the \\nguiding muscles The weakness is strongly shown when the dog attempts \\nto jump onto a chair or the lap which he fails to do and generally falls \\non hte side all in a heap There are very few dogs severely afflicted with \\n\\n\\nr â \\n\\nchorea that ever get completely cured When the attack is but slight the \\ndog may live for years and prove a useful animal as except in severe \\ncases it does not seem to greatly impair the general health The con \\nstant twitching is however so annoying a sight to most people that few \\nwould care to keep a dog thus afflicted Although dogs carefully and \\nproperly treated in distemper are less likely to suffer from this disease \\nyet it will occasionally occur in the best managed kennels and so I must \\nproceed to consider its treatment The first thing to be done is to attend \\nto the general health and especially to see that the bowels are in a properly \\nregulated state and it is better if their action requires correction to \\nendeavor to accomplish that object by a careful regulation of diet rather \\nthan by a resort to physic indeed all through chorea the food must be \\nof a nature easily digested and given with regularity if any course of \\nmedicinal treatment is to be successful The remedies recommended in \\nchorea are arsenic sulphate of zinc nitrate of silver and nux vomica and \\nits preparations Arsenic I do not recommend but either of the following \\nmay be tried and it is sometimes found that using them alternately has \\na more beneficial effect than a perseverance

oldtime remedy and \\n\\nhas cured Chorea when directions were carefully followed \\n\\nâ â€ \\n\\nThe following article on Chorea was written especially for this book \\nby Dent \\n\\nChorea is the most distressing nervous complaint dog owners are \\nfamiliar with It is due to an involuntary nervous discharge of the motor \\ncells controlling certain muscles The essential pathology of these more \\nor less constant muscular twitchings has baffled all scientific investigation \\nand careful microscopic autopsies extending from the nerve terminus in a \\nmuscle back to the cord and brain have failed to reveal a lesion that can \\nbe considered a cause \\n\\nThe most satisfactory theory is that the brain cells controlling a \\ncertain muscle or set of muscles are so weakened by the poison of distemper \\nor some other cause as to cause them to send out muscular impulses with \\nout natural mental impulse or will power \\n\\nThere is a form of chorea clue to a disturbed nervous system induced \\nby blows or injuries to the or the presence of intestinal parasites which \\nhave deranged the digestive organs This form of chorea is generally \\ncurable The form which follows distemper is not so amenable to treat \\nment \\n\\nThe symptoms are so prominent and characteristic that there is no \\nmistaking the disease and the peculiar involuntary twitching of the muscles \\nonce seen is never forgotten Then entire body may be affected generally \\nit is only one set of muscles those of the foreleg or of the neck and shoul \\nders in which case the head bobs up and down in a most helpless manner \\nWhere the hindlegs are affected the dog will suddenly drop one of the limbs \\nfrom the hip downward as if there was an entire loss of strength and \\npower This is particularly noticeable if it attempts to jump on a chair \\nor table for after one or two attempts it falls on its side or in a heap \\ncompletely helpless \\n\\nThe top of the head is often affected and twitches and throbs in a \\nmost peculiar manner and the jerking is commonly observable about the \\nmuscles of the eyelids lips and face In severe cases of chorea the gen \\neral health is affected and the animal shows signs of suffering probably \\ndue to anxiety and appreciation of its helpfulness In mild cases it does \\nnot affect the animals general health and some field dogs have it all \\ntheir lives without affecting their usefulness The owner however \\nis annoyed by the constant muscular movements and is always anxious to \\neffect a cure Some cases are quiet during sleep others are worse \\n\\nTreatment â€” Although the disease occurs in the best regulated ken \\nnels despite the most careful treatment of distemper it does not alter the \\nfact that dogs properly treated for distemper and worms and well housed \\nand fed are less liable to the disease than those which are neglected \\n\\nThe first thing to do is to look after the animals general health \\nSee that the bowels act promptly and this is accomplished best by dieting \\nand the feeding of foods possessing laxative properties and not by resorting \\nto physics If there is the slightest suspicion of worms treat for them \\nas they torment the nervous system beyond all measure and are the cause \\nof many attacks \\n\\nFeed regularly and carefully and if there is a tendency to constipa \\ntion use well boiled oatmeal Mutton broths with stale bread beef well \\nboiled or raw lean beef chopped fine From two to five grains of pepsin \\nand onehalf grain of diastase can be given after each meal to assist the \\nstomach in the process of digestion If there is much debility and weak \\nness give emulson of cod liver oil in doses of from one teaspoonful to \\nthree tablespoonfuls three or four times a day \\n\\nThe drugs principally used are mix vomica or strychnine and arsenic \\nSome practitioners use a dose of nux vomica in the morning and arsenic at \\nnight As both of these drugs are poisonous they must be used with care \\nThe dose of nux vomica is from two to twelve drops of the tincture twice \\na day It is a valuable vegetable bitter and an aid to digestion as well \\nas a nerve stimulant Any stiffness of the muscles or tendency to spasms \\nis an indication for its immediate discontinuance \\n\\nFowlers Solution of Arsenic is the most convenient form The dose \\n\\n\\n46

surgeons battery Obstinate and \\napparently incurable cases sometimes show a decided improvement and \\nradical cures are effected in response to a gentle stimulating current of \\nelectricity One electrode should be applied to the neck directly over the \\nspinal cord the other to the extremity of the affected leg and the electrical \\nstimulation continued for from five to thirty minutes twice a day The \\nbeneficial effects from a careful massage of the leg and a manipulation of \\nthe muscles cannot be overestimated Besides breaking down adhesions \\nor agglutinations of the muscle

indiscriminately applied by sportsmen \\nto spasm from whatever cause but cramp of the limbs from exposure to \\ncold and wet often occurs and it will quickly yield to brisk rubbing and \\nwarmth If nothing else is handy rub with a little spirit and water or a \\nrough dry cloth Dogs used in hunting or retrieving from water are very \\nliable to it the hindquarters being most frequently affected and in such \\ncases a good brisk liniment such as the following should be carried in the \\nboat \\n\\nStimulating Liniment â€” Compound camphor liniment 3 oz olive oil \\nspirit of turpentine and spirit of hartshorn of each 1 oz mix A hot bath \\nis also very effective especially if the dog is afterward gently rubbed \\ncare must however be taken to dry the animal thoroughly \\n\\nCrooked Limbs â€” See Rickets \\n\\nCancer â€” This can only safely be treated by the verterinary surgeon \\nThe main thing for the dogs owner is to be able to distinguish between \\ncancer and other tumors The safest plan is however not to take any \\nchance by delay but on suspicion consult the veterinarian \\n\\nChoking â€” This accident is not uncommon with greedy animals that \\nbolt their food a bone a piece of gristly meat or other hard substance \\nis bolted and sticks fast in its passage to the stomach I always adopt \\n\\nthe plan of reserving bones until after the clogs have fed for if given with \\nthe other food they are at once picked out and the smaller ones are \\nwhen the dog is hungry apt to be swallowed unmasticated and produce \\nchoking \\n\\nTreatment â€” Frequently by manipulating the throat outside with the \\nfingers the obstruction can be worked down the gullet or if it can be felt \\nin the upper part of the throat it may be removed by the throat forceps \\nwhich most veterinary surgeons keep by them Hill recommends when the \\nsubstance is too low for extraction and manipulating with the fingers \\nexternally fails to endeavor gently to force it down with a piece of bent \\nwhalebone having a piece of sponge tied to the end of it and dipped in \\noil In using this extra care must be taken that the sponge is so firmly \\nattached to the whalebone that it cannot slip off for if swallowed it might \\neffectually block up one of the smaller intestines therefore cut nitches \\nin the whalebone into which tie the piece of sponge As soreness if not \\nactual laceration is almost sure to be caused the dog should for some \\ndays after be confined to soft food \\n\\nThe following on choking I found The subject is so ably treated \\nthat I publish it also \\n\\nThis is of very frequent occurrence with dogs as usually they are \\nvoracious feeders careless of consequences and the fact that they use \\ntheir mouths much as we do our hands in grasping and conveying various \\nobjects makes them particularly liable to swallow foreign substances that \\nmay become lodged in the gullet The commonest objects on which dogs \\nchoke are bones that they have been feeding upon If the bone lodges \\nin the back of the throat it may set up such a violent coughing and \\nretching as to asphyxiate the subject The back of the throat however is \\nnot the usual lodging place for as a rule the bone or other object passes \\nthat point where the gullet is comparatively large and lodges over the \\nheart where it is smaller Locating at this point causes the greatest \\ndistress The dog keeps gulping as if trying to swallow and from time \\nto time is seized with a period of retching In a day or two the extreme \\ndistress passes and the patient drinks water and milk or other liquids \\nfreely and can also swallow raw eggs but if solid food is taken directly \\nit reaches the obstruction it lodges Young dogs and those which are \\nplayful sometimes swallow needles and pins These usually become \\nimbedded in the back of the tongue and can be removed from that position \\nbut sometimes they reach the gullet and pass through into the tissues \\nforming an abscess their usual location being just behind the angle of \\nthe jaw Removing needles and pins from the back of the tongue is done \\nmost easily with a pair of forceps although it sometimes can be done with \\nthe finger The principal thing is to be careful not to break the object \\nThe symptoms in these cases are usually very severe so that prompt action \\nis necessary In those cases where a bone has pased far down the gullet \\nand lodged over the heart it is sometimes sufficient to feed the dog a few \\npieces of meat which will force the obstruction on If this is not success \\nful a probang must be uesd to force the obstruction down into the stom \\nach but this should be attempted only by a skillful veterinarian or a \\nphysician as it may be necessary to use considerable force and there is \\n\\n\\n48 jdanger of rupturing the gullet which is fatal If the obstruction cannot \\nbe removed by the probang then the only thing remaining is to feed \\nthe patient on liquid food until such time as the sharp points of the bone \\nbecome dissolved and rounded off so that it will be easily pushed along \\nby the probang \\n\\nCHLOROFORMING DOGS FOR AN OPERATION \\n\\nIf it is really necessary to do this then have a careful anethetist who \\nunderstands his subject do the work A quarter of an hour is long enough \\nfor a dog to be kept under the influence and should be ample time for any \\noperation Chloroform is dangerous at best with any dogs and with some \\nbreeds Chow Chows for instance it is sure to mean a dead dog Anyone \\nwho has had experience in the destruction of dogs with chloroform knows \\nhow quickly they succumb to it Ether is a safer anesthetic which can \\nbe used with as much success and far less risk \\n\\nIf an anesthetic has to be given ask the operating surgeon to use \\nether The bet way to give an anesthetic put on a wire cage muzzle \\nhaving first secured dog so he cannot struggle Around the muzzle an \\nordinary piece of surgeons list can be placed and on this the anesthetic \\n\\nFor many minor operations liquid cocaine can be used instead the \\ndog strapped

gently on teats that are \\nhard and caked for a few days gradually getting down to twice and then \\nonce a day stopping as the flow of milk gets less \\n\\nAlso use quite often every two hours or so camphorated oil or gum \\ncamphor and lard melted together which should be kept in a corked \\njar rubbing this in well on all the teats This will dry up the milk \\nsoften up the caked breasts and dry up the hanging down bag as well \\nmaking the bitch more sightly looking A solution of camphor tannin \\nand glycerine which any druggist can put up for you is the very best \\nthing to use alone

and so \\nwear the claws down suffer from an overgrowth of them The nail curls \\nround and if not cut in time it grows into the sole of the foot causing \\nsoreness and lameness The ends of the claws should be cut off with \\na pair of sharp strong nippers or nail clippers such as one can buy at \\nany cutlers for 7 5 cents Puppies toe nails especially of those running \\non grass or on boards in winter grow long and tend to spread the toes \\nopen when the latter should be compact Extreme care should be ob \\nserved that only the dead white or light colored nails is cut off and when \\nthe nail is dark judgment must be exercised It is best to clip little \\nand often and especially so if the nail has a tendency to grow in \\n\\nIn cases which have been neglected the process of removal should \\nbe gradual a small portion being taken off every few days or so until \\nthe claws are of the normal length If the sole or flesh has been pene \\ntrated it will most likely fester and should

that live in freedom although \\nexposed to changes of temperature and weather are not so liable to attacks \\nof catarrh as are those more delicately reared in whom a sudden change \\nfrom the close atmosphere of the room to the open air or exposure to a \\nshower of rain frequently will produce a cold First symptoms are shiv \\nering and evident languor succeeded by a hot dry nose with a thin

more or less discharge \\nfrom the nose sometimes accompanied with sneezing and if severe and \\nthe bronchial tubes affected a cough will be the result It is pretty well \\nunderstood when applied to ourselves that a cold uncared for is most \\n\\nlikely to lead to serious illness and it is no less true of the dog See \\nalso Ozaena In puppies the symptoms of common cold may be mis \\ntaken for

generally supposed Their locality varies may exist in the biliary \\nducts the bladder the kidneys or in the urethra the passage of the penis \\nIn Biliary Calculi those stones situated in the biliary ducts providing \\nthey are sufficiently small to pass the duct are not of great moment â€” in \\nfact upin post mortem their existence has often been discovered while \\nduring life po pain or inconvenience was noticed but should these stones \\nbe too large to pass the ducts they are very painful and a most fruitful \\ncause of jaundice The bile which in health passes through these ducts \\nbecomes completely impeded in its progress and is reabsorbed by the \\nblood vessels entering the general system and jaundice is established \\nThe symptoms of biliary calculi when not completly blocking the ducts \\nare excessive sickness and constipation with pain in the abdomen The \\ntreatment should consist in allaying the pain when the stone will fre \\n\\n\\n52 fquently pass in a natural way For this give 5 to 30 drops tincture of \\nopium every four hours in a little water and a soap and water enema \\nnight and morning to relieve the bowels opium having a tendency to con \\nstipate \\n\\nCystic Calculi is stone found in the bladder It is supposed that \\ntheir existence is rare but such is not the case A single large stone is \\nnot frequently seen but a number of small ones especially in old dogs \\nis not at all uncommon In the former case nothing short of an opera \\ntion can possibly effect a cure but when one takes into consideration the \\nnecessity of keeping a patient in one position after the operation it will \\nbe patent to most that in canine practice the removal of the stone is \\nseldom if ever attended with success Small calculi will frequently pass \\nfrom the bladder into the urinary passages and if small enough out of \\nthe body through the penis but often these stones will become fixed in \\nthe urethra and the dog is unable to pass its water The bladder be \\ncomes distended and if not relieved rupture of the organ results When \\nyou find a dog cannot pass its water get a catheter rub a little olive oil \\nor vaseline upon it and the instrument inserted at the tip of the penis Of \\ncourse the dog must be placed on its back Insert the catheter very \\ngently and gradually pass it into the bladder If there is a small calculus \\nin the urethra the passage of the catheter will be obstructed and while \\nthis is so no extreme force must be used or a very extensive injury may \\nresult A little gentle and prolonged pressure may return the stone into \\nthe bladder and so allow the urine to pass If the stone cannot be re \\nturned in this attempt inject into the passage of the penis a little olive \\noil and repeat the operation with the catheter Calculi sometimes exist in \\nthe kidneys and may pass into the bladder thence through the urinary \\npassage and so out of the body but at other times they become too large \\nto leave the organ causing intense pain and subsequent death The symp \\ntoms are first stiffness across the loins accompanied by pain when an \\nattempt is made to move the urine is passed in small quantities and is \\nfrequently â€” indeed often â€” tinged with blood In such cases it is a matter \\nof relieving the pain with the hope that the stone is small enough to gain \\nan exit by the penis To relieve the pain give 5 to 30 drops of tincture \\nof opium about every four hours and apply hot flannels to the loins A \\ndose of oil to relieve the bowels is beneficial as any straining in passing \\nthe faeces would increase the pain It is best to leave these cases to the \\nveterinarian \\n\\nDew Claws â€” Darwin describes as accidental monstrosities yet a gen \\neral opinion prevails that dew claws are the peculiar inheritance of a few \\nbreeds of dogs and from this false idea possession or nonpossession of \\nthese now utterly useles clumy and ugly appendange has been set up \\nas a test of purity or impurity of breeding in specimens of the variety \\nof which they are wrongly ascribed as being the peculiar property The \\ndew claw is attached to a rudiment more or less developed of an addi \\ntamentary phalange or toe situated on the inner side one to each foot dis \\ntant from and considerably above the other toes \\n\\n\\nI \\n\\nThese additional toes are frequently unattached to any corresponding \\nmetacarpal or metatarsal bone having only a ligamentary union so that \\nthe term is equally applicable to the extra toe often seen on the foreleg \\nand as they are neither useful nor ornamental I would in all cases have \\nthem removed being only a disfigurement in any breed This should be \\ndone when the pups are with the dam as she will take care of the wound \\nand heal it up by licking it and this can be easily done with a pair of \\nstrong scissors If left till the dog is older they are liable to bleed a good \\ndeal and the pain of course is greater in such case the wound produced \\nby the excision should be at once well saturated with frairs balsam If \\nit is thought well to remove the nail only that can be done by pulling it \\nout with a pair of nippers \\n\\nDESTRUCTION OF DOGS \\n\\nIt is often necessary to destroy dogs that have become so crippled or \\ninjured as to make cure very doubtful and in most litters of puppies \\nthere are some so puny or so wanting in the characteristics of the breed \\nthat they ought not to be reared In the latter case it is most humane to \\ndestroy such as are not wanted as soon after they are born as possible but \\neven when a mesalliance has taken place one at least of the puppies should \\nbe left with the dam unless one or more foster pups of pure blood can \\nbe substituted \\n\\nFor destroying young puppies there is no more convenient or less \\npainful method than drowning while for mature dogs a teaspoonful of \\nScheeles prussic acid will cause instantaneous death In giving it the \\nmouth of the dog should be held open and upwards and the acid poured \\nwell back on the tongue The very greatest care is however necessary \\nin dealing with a drug of such potency and it would be highly dangerous \\nto life if any of it were spilled over a cut or wound \\n\\nThe above was written I think by F J Skinner as I got it from Field \\nand Fancy and give it as good advise I bave used the prussic acid in \\ncases of an old and helpless dog that had to be put out of the way and \\nit worked very quickly as its action goes direct to the heart the pain so \\nshort that it seems to be humane Lately I have cloroformed several \\nand rather favor the chloroform route I lay the dog down on its side my \\nright hand under a piece of carpet on which is some cotton in the center \\nand have an assistant pour on this cotton the chloroform and I then quickly \\napply this to the nose of the dog the cotton and quickly pull the carpet \\naround the head to neck holding it there so no air can get in the assis \\ntant meanwhile holding the back part and legs of dog The dog will gen \\nerally resist the fumes of the chloroform but only for a few seconds and \\nin about a minute he will be dead providing he has not gotten the carpet \\nloose and some air thereby \\n\\nDrowning is as painless as any death can be especially for puppies \\nI get a pail fill it partly full of water bave a pan that fits the top of the \\npail put puppies in the pan on quickly and on top of the pan a rock or \\nlump of coal heavy enough to hold pan down and then I go away \\n\\nDebility and Wasting â€” It happens sometimes that a dog gradually \\n\\n\\nV \\n\\nbecomes weak and wasting in flesh and you havent found the cause In \\nsuch cases Eberharts Tonic Pills are just what the dog should have for \\na few weeks as they can do no harm but will do great good in building a \\nrun down dog up create an appetite and work on all the organs invigorat \\ning the system They are different from other condition pills as they \\ncontain no arsenic or dope of any kind Add to the dogs diet for \\na few days some raw lean beef cut up fine sprinkled with a little pepsin \\nonce a day Also look for any symptoms of divergence from health which \\nmay indicate the cause of the trouble \\n\\nDocking Tails â€” While this is not a disease yet it happens frequently \\nthat puppies suffer not a little from this being clumsily done It is not a \\npainful operation if properly done and before puppy is weaned Fox ter \\nriers poodles and a few other breeds should have their tails docked to \\nconform to present bench show requirements An old superstition exists \\nwith some people yet that a tail must be bitten off which is simply erron \\neous and disgusting Never use a shears or scissors as the pinching before \\nthe cut would cause more pain than the cutting Before you are ready to \\ncut the tail get an ounce of tincture of iron Have a solid block or table \\nhave an assistant hold the puppy up to it with its tail laid on the block \\ncalculate how long or short a tail you want three inches is about right \\nthen let assistant hold puppy up to table with tail lying on it have a sharp \\nbutcher knife ready and with one quick and rapid cut the tail is off Tip \\nyour bottle of tincture of iron up to and against the end of tail and drop \\nyour pup down in the yard I have docked the tails of a litter of poodle \\npups when not one of them gave a cry or yelp from the operation but \\ndid not seem to notice it at all and went on playing as usual as if nothing \\nhad occurred The mother will lick and take care of the tails and they \\nwill heal up in due time Pull the skin back with your left hand when \\nyou are ready to do the cutting \\n\\nDysentery â€” This is a more dangerous disease than diarrhea which \\nwhen protracted sometimes causes it and may be described as diarrhea \\nin its most aggravated form there is generally feverishness present con \\nsiderable pain and the evacuations are often black in color and very offen \\nsive and followed by discharge of a gelationouslike substance mixed with \\nblood The loss of strength is very rapid and the dog must be supported \\nby drenching with beef tea and a little port wine in it the medicine and \\ngeneral treatment being the same as in diarrhea In one case of this kind \\nin a retriever I gave two doses of twenty drops of chlorodyne with very \\ngood effect The discharges in dysentery are immediately caused by in \\nflammation of the mucous membrane lining in intestines and are distin \\nguished from diarrhea by containing no fecal matter except occasionally \\nwTaen it is voided in lumps but the ordinary evacuations in dysentery \\nalthough they vary in appearance are generally slimy looking and com \\nposed of mucus mixed with blood and in the advanced stages of the \\ndisease pus is discharged and shreds of the mucus membrane very offen \\nsive in character The disease is very weakening causes great pain and \\n\\nstraining and is very difficult to manage it often occurs in protracted \\ncases of distemper and carries off the patient \\n\\nIn treating dysentery the anodyne mixture given in diarrhea treat \\nment should be tried in the first instance alone and if ineffectual one of \\nthe following pills for a dog of 60lb to SOlb every four hours may be \\ntried with good results For smaller dogs half a pill \\n\\nPills for Dysentery \\n\\nTake of tannic acid 2 scruples and pure sulphate of copper 1 dram \\npowdered opium 20 grains mixed and divide into twenty pills or if a \\nliquid medicine should be preferred the following will answer Take of \\npure sulphate of copper 48 grains dissolve in 2 ounces of cinnamon wa \\nter add V2 ounce of tincture of catechu y2 ounce of laudanum 6 drams of \\naromatic spirits of ammonia and make up to 12 ounces with cinnamon \\nwater Dose for an 80lb dog two tablespoonfuls every four hours smaller \\ndogs in proportion Clysters of starch with one dram of laudanum in each \\nare often very beneficial and one may be thrown up every four or five \\nhours \\n\\nThe patient should have perfect rest all evacuations should be in \\nstantly removed and the place where the patient is which should be warm \\nbut airy kept sweet with disinfectants The food should consist of pearl \\nbarley rice arrowroot or wheaten flour boiled in milk varied with strong \\nbeef tea slightly thickened with stale bread or plain biscuit \\n\\nI have cured dogs of dysentery of long standing obstinate cases with \\nthe following prescription which was found to be very valuable in the \\ntreatment of such cases in the human race â€” of soldiers who contracted this \\ndisease in the war of 61 A friend of mine a noted doctor in human prac \\ntice gave it to me and I tried it on a dog succeeding in effecting a per \\nmanent cure since which time I have used it in several such cases with \\nsuccess Take sima ruba bark two ounces and put it in a quart of water \\nboil this down to a pint then strain and boil this down to half a pint \\nBe careful to not burn The dose for a dog the size of a pointer would \\nbe a teaspoonful three times a day Large dogs like a St Bernard two \\nteaspoonfuls at a dose while very small toy dogs like a toy terrier should \\nhave half a teaspoonful at a time \\n\\nThe following prescription was furnished me by Mr J A Rogers of \\nIronton Ohio after trying it on his pointer that had suffered with chronic \\ndysentery for over a month till the dog was a skeleton and could hardly \\nstand up This dog had been treated for worms at first supposed to be \\nthe cause of the trouble and several wellknown remedies tried but no \\nworms and no stoppage of the dysentery As a last resort he tried this \\nprescription and cured the dog From a full history of this extreme case \\nfurnished me by several letters during its duration I have concluded that \\nthis is a very valuable remedy and likely to cure when everything else fails \\n\\nSpecific aconite 10 drops \\n\\nSpecific baptisia 10 drops \\n\\nSpecific ipecac 15 drops \\n\\nSpecific ecefolta 1 dram \\n\\n\\nfGlycerine â€ â€ â€ 4 drams \\n\\nAdd water distilled to make 8 ounces \\n\\nOf the first four articles use only Lloyd Bros preparations â€” a Cincinnati \\nwholesale drug firm If your druggist doesnt have them in stock he can \\nget them by ordering from Lloyd Bros or I can get this prescription \\nfilled and send you The dose would be at first â€” until you see a change \\nfor the better â€” a teaspoonful every hour until three or four doses are given \\nthen every two hours Of course if the patient should be a very young \\npuppy the dose should be smaller but such cases of dysentery are seldom \\nfound in puppies except when a very great looseness of the bowels appears \\ngenerally due to worms such cases very likely will be cured by proper \\nworm treatment which find under heading of Worms In above pre \\nscription the ecefolta is most excellent for the blood bloodpoisoning and \\nas a disinfectant to kill germs and to reduce fever which every dog has \\nin a case of dysentery Dog also has a cold which the aconite will relieve \\nThe baptisia is for fever and the blood the ipecac for the stomach and \\nmucous membrane of the stomach and bowels I will add here that this \\nremedy was intended by the regular doctor who prescribed it for this dog \\nâ€” for humans but was tried and successfully on the dog in this case \\nWorms may have been the original cause of this case of dysentery Dry \\nbrowned toast soaked in meat broths or gravy is very good food to use in \\nsuch cases of dysentery \\n\\nDent has written especially for this book the following on Dysentery \\n\\nThis disease is frequently neglected with the false hope that it will \\ncure itself It is a serious affection and demands prompt care and treat \\nment Causes are inflammation of the mucous membrane of the lower \\nbowels or large intestines accompanied by ulceration and in many cases \\nbleeding The action of poisons eating of putrid food rapid changes from \\nheat to cold and vice versa also the aftereffects of inflammation of the \\nsmall intestines \\n\\nSymptoms â€” At first there is a loss of appetite restlessness painful \\ncondition of the bowels as attested by pressure on the belly The nose is \\nhot and dry the animal is feverish and at first constipated Afterwards \\nthe bowels after more or less straining begin

stale food from one meal to another is a common source \\nof this disease Diarrhea may be classed as acute and chronic In the \\nacute form there is much looseness of the bowels frequently accompanied \\nor preceded by copious vomiting of acrid offensive matter the evacua \\ntions are loose watery and offensive If not checked it soon produces \\nexcessive weakness and especially in puppies is the cause of great mor \\ntality In the chronic state the disease is slower in its progress and longer \\nin its duration It may be set up by a diseased liver and excess of bile or \\nit may be the result of inflammation of the bowels A by no means un \\ncommon cause is the abuse of calomel and other mercurials these being \\nspecifics with many persons for all dog diseases Diarrhea often finishes \\nup the work of distemper and this is so in most cases where as too fre \\nquently happens mercurials have been relied on as a cure for that dis \\nease Worms are also a common cause of diarrhea and when these exist \\nthe nature of the discharge is variable frequent and small in quantity \\nSometimes lumpy followed by gelatinous glary matter and often frothy \\nand covered with small air bubbles When worms appear to be the cause \\nmeans should be taken to expel them as directed later on Exhalations \\nfrom accumulations of filth and especially in low lying damp and badly \\ndrained and badly ventilated kennels are also a cause of diarrhea and \\none which never should exist In treating diarrhea it is often of con \\nsiderable advantage to give a mild purge to remove the irritating cause \\nCastor oil is very suitable and if there is evidence of much pain attend \\ning the disease a dose of laudanum from 20 to 30 drops may be added \\nAs a remedy in diarrhea I know of nothing equal to the following mix \\nture which very rarely fails to check it if the patient at the same time \\nreceives proper attention in other respects \\n\\nAstringent Anodyne Mixture for Diarrhea \\n\\nTake

little port wine to the food in \\nstead of plain water give rice or barley water to drink In the case of \\nbitches suckling the diet must be changed a dose of castor oil given and \\nthe astringent anodyne mixture in small closes or an injection may be \\nadministered \\n\\nIf the diarrhea is very persistent and accompanied by blood inject \\ntwice a day into the rectum 2 gr to 5 gr of sulphate

from its \\nsocket for instance in dislocation of the hip the head of the thigh bone \\nis generally carried upwards and backwards this being apparent to the \\neye as the injured side is thereby made higher and can readily be felt \\nHave an assistant to hold the dog around the loins steady in one position \\nwhile you take hold of the dislocated limb above the stifle joint which will \\nretract the thigh bone downward and forward In similar operations you \\nmust be guided by the same principle Rest will be needed for the pa \\ntient and violent exercise must not be allowed for some time

discussion over this disease which is \\nso alarming in the human family While some veterinarians hold that \\nthis disease does not exist in dogs others contend as religiously that it does \\n\\nThere are cases on record where a dog has contracted the disease \\nfrom eating the food that had previously been placed before an affected \\nchild and it is reasonable to presume that the disease is communicable \\nfrom man to dog and vice versa when we consider the intimate terms under \\nwhich they exist \\n\\nThe cause of this disease in the dog as in man is a specific germ \\nwhich attacks the throat or nose or both and extends from them down \\ninto the wind pipe \\n\\nSymptoms â€” Difficulty in swallowing more or less difficulty in breath \\ning chills fever marked debility and exhaustion \\n\\nTreatment â€” The slightest suspicion of this disease calls for isolation \\nincreased attention to sanitation careful disinfection and the attenton of a \\nskillful veterinarian

am quite at a loss to explain why congenital deafness is so much \\noftener seen in white dogs or those with a preponderance of white than \\nin those of any other color Bulldogs bull terriers and white English \\nterriers seem to be peculiarly liable to this defect Deafness is also fre \\nquently caused by accumulations of wax and this can be removed by syring \\ning the ear daily with 1 part of spirits of wine and 20 parts of warm water \\nafterwards drying the ear thoroughly by means of a piece of wool rolled \\nupon a probe or pointed piece of stick Several fresh pieces of wool will be \\nnecessary Canker is also a fruitful cause of deafness \\n\\nI know of no treatment for congenital deafness likely to be of any \\nuse except when it is caused by a morbid growth capable of being removed \\nAmong other causes producing deafness blows may be mentioned also \\nlugging at the ear â€” a most brutal mode of punishment often resorted to \\nby keepers and those having the care of sporting field dogs â€” and the lodg \\nment of water in the ear cavity In the latter case pouring in a little pure \\noil of sweet almonds may give relief and in the other cases the treatment \\nrecommended for internal canker may be beneficially followed with in \\naddition the application of a blister behind the ears Whilst the dog is \\nunder treatment cooling aperient medicine should be given and a light \\ndiet with green vegetables adopted You will find that dogs born deaf \\nlike a deaf and dumb person have their other senses quickened and the \\ndog will be remarkably sharp at interpreting signs given by the master \\nwho should adopt a system of signs and keep to them If you own a deaf \\ndog you should have an enclosed yard for him so no danger of his getting \\nout on the street and hurt or killed by a passing wagon or street car â€” \\nand remember if you have him out for a walk that he is deaf so that no \\nharm befalls him you do the watching out in this case

This is a disease unfortunately common in \\ndogs it varies greatly in severity and in some cases when arising from \\nconstitutional causes becomes chronic Sporting dogs have been said to \\nbe more liable to it than other breeds but I do not think so and I believe \\nthe idea originated from the fact that these have generally been more ex \\nposed to circumstances exciting it than other breeds From my own exper \\nience I am inclined to think it is more prevalent in pugs and other pets \\noverfed and consequently liable to frequent derangement of the digestive \\norgans \\n\\nAnything that

undoubtedly possessing contagious qualities This affection is known \\nas contagious optbalmia Perhaps the most marked illustration of this va \\nriety of the affection in the dog is that which is associated with distemper \\nand it may be noted here that by the term opthalmia is meant the disease \\nwhich implicates the eyeball itself \\n\\nThe symptoms are an intolerance of light and a watery discharge \\nand on the eyelids being opened and examined there is seen to be conges \\ntion of the lining membrane and across the cornea or front clear portion \\nof the eye there are red streaks and ulceration soon follows and a white \\nfilm abscures the eye and interferes with the sight \\n\\nMore or less opacity of the cornea is one of the symptoms of opthalmia \\neither of the simple and contagious variety and in the case of the dog \\naffected with the ophthalmia of distemper the indications are of a most \\nmarked character The conjunctival membrane is highly injected and \\nreddened the cornea becomes opaque early in the disease and very fre \\nquently a small spot of ulceration appears in the center of it which rapidly \\nextends and in many cases penetrates the cornea completely allowing \\nthe fluid in the anterior chamber of the eye to escape A profuse dis \\ncharge of a purulent character continues during the whole course of the \\ndisease and one of the annoying features of the complaint is the glueing \\ntogether of the eyelids which can only be separated by very careful and \\ncontinued fomentations of warm water or what is better warm milk \\n\\nWhen treating the cause should be first sought for and if it is some \\nforeign irritating body or an eyelash growing in a wrong direction these \\nshould be removed A mild dose of cooling aperient medicine should be \\ngiven and the eye should be well and frequently bathed with a decoction \\nof poppy heads and afterward if the inflammation is considerable the \\nfollowing lotion may be used several times a day with advantage \\n\\nEye Lotion â€” Extract of belladonna half a dram rose water four \\nounces wine of opium two drams â€” mixed \\n\\nEye Cataract of the â€” This is an opacity of the eyeball a whitish \\nopaque spot which gradually enlarges and has generally ended in blind \\nness It is supposed to be incurable by our best authorities generally \\noccurring in aged dogs â€” these are evidences of failing health and probable \\nbreaking up of the system It frequently follows ophtalmia but might be \\nthe result of inflammation or a wound or blow My Eye Lotion No 2 \\nwill do some good even in such cases \\n\\nEar Canker Internal â€” There are two forms of this disease internal \\nand external the latter generally the result of the former I will first \\nprescribe for internal Canker is a term generally applied to different \\nobstinate corroding or heating humors horses having it in the feet \\nsheep having foot rot but unless the irritation is caused in the foot \\nof the dog sometimes by hard running on rough ground causing canker \\n\\nous sores and which should be treated the same as internal ear canker \\nit is not found in dogs except in the ear \\n\\nCauses â€” First of all and most common is some injury such as blows \\non the ear or pulling the ears a habit some people have as a method of \\ncorrection and one that is most pernicious Others of which probably \\nthe principal one is getting the cars full of water in diving swimming or \\nretrieving from water followed by lack of exercise too rich food dirty \\ndamp kennel to sleep in and excess of fat as it is often found in fat lazy \\ndogs \\n\\nCanker may be the result of exposure to cold overfeeding the pres \\nence of insects foreign bodies or an accumulation of wax in the ear are \\nalso fertile causes while the most common is the washing of dogs with \\ncoarse alkaline soaps which are totally unfit for the sensitive skin of the \\ndog The soap during the washing gains access to the ear setting up \\ndangerous inflammation \\n\\nHugh Dalziel says Is there not another and frequent cause â€” whether \\nthose sportsmen do not often produce it who instead of correcting \\ntheir dogs by the legitimate means of the voice and the whip resort \\nto another method much to be condemned Lugging a dog is as cruel \\nas kicking him neither is a fit mode of punishment and the former \\nvery likely to produce canker \\n\\nEar canker is one of the nuisances of dog keeping and when neg \\nlected is a most obstinate complaint The experienced dogman is always \\non the alert but the novice may not detect the trouble until the ear \\ndischarges an acrid secretion The careful kennelman will examine his \\ndogs ears as a part of the daily grooming \\n\\nInternal Canker is an inflammation of the lining membrane of the \\npassage to the ear which if neglected turns into ulceration and suppuration \\nand when of long standing a blackish offensive discharge takes place \\naccumulating in the air passage and the interior of the ear will be found \\nred and inflamed \\n\\nWhen you notice the following symptoms begin at once to treat him \\nfor it the sooner the better to save your dog pain and yourself trouble \\n\\nThe dog thus suffering will be observed frequently scratching his ear \\nwith his paw holding his head on one side giving it a violent shake as \\nthough to empty something out the pain and irritation causing him to \\nthus shake his head whereby the flaps of they ear get bruised ulcerations \\nform the tips become sore the inflammation in the interior lining mem \\nbrane extends to the outside and from the shaking and scratching is formed \\nexternal canker \\n\\nWhen a dog shakes his head scratches his ear with his paw and \\nholds his head to one side it is high time to investigate and apply remedies \\n\\nThe acrid discharges if not cleared away will lead to irritation of \\nthe flap of the ear the flap swells and looks angry often breaking out in \\nsores at the tips and edges This is external canker The peculiarly of \\nfensive odor of the ear passage is a sure sign of internal canker \\n\\nTreatment â€” Wash out the ear with warm water and soapsuds use \\neither Castile or Eberharts Dog Soap rinse with clean warm water and \\n\\n\\nperoxyde of hydrogen one part of peroxyde to four parts of water by \\nmeasure \\n\\nDry out the ear with absorbent cotton swabs made by rolling cotton \\nloosely on a skewer or clean piece of stick Dry thoroughly \\n\\nThe ear is now ready for treatment and here is my remedy which has \\nnever failed to cure the most obstinate cases even of long standing and \\nI give this as having proved to be an infallible cure \\n\\nI cured a valuable poodle that had a bad case in both ears for a \\nyear three veterinarians having treated the dog and failed to cure him \\nThe dog was then shipped to my kennels and I sent him back in a few \\nweeks entirely cured This was the worst case I ever saw or handled \\nand I cured him with the prescription herewith given \\n\\nIodine 16 grains \\n\\nIodide of potassium 32 grains \\n\\nMix these two first in a tablespoonful of water and then add one pint \\nof pure cider vinegar Keep in bottle corked up \\n\\nAfter ear has been cleaned out and dried as directed take your dog \\nand lay his head on your knee and pour in or inject with a rubber syringe \\nif he will hold still about a tablespoonful of the remedy into the ear and \\ngently work or knead it in for a few minutes Do this once a day only \\nuntil the ear gets better and then every other day is often enough You \\ncan look for a cure of ordinary cases in a week or less if treatment was \\nbegun promptly at first signs neglected cases requiring more time \\n\\nHere are several other good remedies \\n\\nCreolin 30 grains \\n\\nSulphate of zinc 16 grains \\n\\nWater 8 ounces \\n\\nThis one should be injected twice daily after cleansing the ear same \\nas or the first remedy given \\n\\nThis one is to be used three times a day Cleanse the ear with in \\njections of equal parts of peroxyde of hydrogen and water three timefe a \\nday then injeet two teaspoonfuls of the following Sulphate of zinc one \\ndram sugar of lead two drams glycerine two ounces water six ounces \\n\\nAnd this one to be used twice a day Sulphate of zinc ten grains \\nacetate of lead thirty grains credlin onehalf ounce glycerine three ounces \\nwater to make eight ounces inject a tablespoonful into the ear twice a \\nday \\n\\nThe discharge from the ear will cause sores on the inside of flap so \\nwhen injecting the medicine wash these sores with the same My iodine \\nprescription is especially good for these sore spots Injecting with rubber \\nsyringe is always best if your dog will hold quiet and not resist treatment \\nand in his struggling injurs the ear from the syringe If you cant con \\ntrol and keep him quiet then pouring it in will do the main objection being \\n\\nmedicine wasted I find very little trouble in giving any dog medicine \\nfor I go at him easy and gently talking to him and thus giving him to \\nunderstand that his doctor is his friend There are few dogs that you \\ncannot talk to and reason with kind treatment very soon winning their \\nconfidence You can of course tell when ear is cured as the discharge and \\noffensive smell ceases ear looks healthy and dog has stopped scratching \\nand shaking his head \\n\\nIt cannot be too firmly insisted upon that whenever a dog is suffer \\ning from ear canker or from any eruption or skin disease it is quite neces \\nsary to give a good internal medicine as it is to apply a suitable external \\nlotion The only blood medicine known to many dog fanciers is sulphur \\nA new prescription therefore may not be out of place here The follow \\ning may be made up into pills and will prove an excellent allround \\ntonic and blood purifier Take of \\n\\nSulphate of iron dried 12 grains \\n\\nSulphate of quinine 6 grains \\n\\nBicarbonate of soda dried 24 grains \\n\\nLiquorice Root Powder and Extract of Gentian â€” Sufficient of each to \\n\\nform a suitable mass \\n\\nDivide the above Into twelve pills one of which morning and night \\nwill do for a dog of 20 lbs More or less in proportion for other dogs \\nOr Dents or Claytons Blood Purifying Pills are also both good to use \\nin old or very bad cases This cannot be done with one box perhaps any \\nmore than you could cure yourself with a single bottle of spring medi \\ncine if your blood was out of order so keep up treatment until desired \\nresult has been accomplished \\n\\nEar Canker External â€” This generally follows or appears in connec \\ntion with internal canker due to the poisonous discharge from ear caus \\ning sores on the flap or edges of ear The tears and scratches from briars \\nand thorns in working hunting dogs in close coverts if not given attention \\nmay also set up external caker Exteral canker is a sore or sores much \\nof the nature of a cancer a sore appearing on the outside or inside of \\nthe ear which eats a hole through to the other side if not arrested It \\nis much harder t cure than internal canker It often exists as a se \\nquence of inflammation ulceration or suppuration of the internal passage \\nExternal canker often starts especially in hounds and pointers or any \\nlongeared dogs with a small sore that gradually eats into the flap until \\nit makes a slit in the ear that continues to grow deeper and will be per \\nhaps a quarter inch wide This will be scabbed over on edges of the slit \\nwith a thin scab bleeding a good deal due to dog continallv shaking his \\nhead Make a hood or cap of a piece of canvas of sufficient length to \\nreach around the dogs head having two pieces of tape running through \\na hem at each side lengthwise by which you can draw the cap tight enough \\naround the dogs neck behind tho ears and agan just above the eyes \\ntying them underneath This hood or cap prevents dog from irritating the \\nears by flapping them \\n\\n\\nTreatment â€” First wash and dry the sores nicely then touch the sore \\nedges twice a day with following solution Sulphate of copper one dram \\nto an ounce of water Here are several other remedies Yellow oxide \\nof mercury 15 grains to one ounce of simple ointment Mix and use \\nonce a day to sores after having first cleaned them Another is if any of \\nthe sores look angry scrape with a knife a little blue stone into fine \\npowder and dust the ear with it or after bathing and drying nicely touch \\nthem with a point of lunar caustic As soon as you have cauterized the \\nsores apply a damp sponge or cloth \\n\\nQuoting Hugh Dalziel â€” There are other cases where the whole of \\nthe external ear becomes swollen and tender the flap thickened and filled \\nwith fluid between the skin and the cartilage or gristle in such cases \\nthe best plan is after bathing the ears well to cut them with a lancet \\npress out the bloody matter and having again well washed and softly \\ndried the ears let them be touched with the following \\n\\nLead Liniment \\n\\nGoulards extract of lead 1 ounce \\n\\nGlycerine and carbolic acid ounce \\n\\nFinest olive oil 4 y2 ounces \\n\\nMix the two first named and add the oil gently rubbing together \\nin a mortar Shake bottle well before using In getting the gly \\ncerine and carbolic acid from your druggist I mean it to be one \\npart pure carbolic acid in five parts \\n\\nThere is also a mangy affection of the ear which might be confounded \\nwith external canker in such cases the edges of the ear become dry hot \\nand scaly and hair come out but this is not ear canker and should be \\ntreated as mange with Eberharts Skin Cure applying it twice daily rub \\nbing it on until ear softens up and gently scraping off the hair with the \\nfingers \\n\\nEnlarged Joints â€” All large joints are not diseased In selecting a \\npup from a litter the big jointed ones ore to be preferred Enlarged joints \\nfrom the want of the hard earthy materials in the bone which makes them \\nyielding so that they cannot support the weight of the body consequently \\ngiving away producing deformity are however often met with caused \\ngenerally by bad food lack of good water fresh air and sunshine See \\nRickets \\n\\nEar Polypus in the â€” This will occur sometimes in the lining mem \\nbrane of the external meatus Their removal should be left to the vet \\nerinary

\\n\\nErythema â€” A superficial inflammation of the skin Dogs occasionally \\nhave it not often a serious matter though at times quite obstinate The \\nskin peels leaving the part tender and sore The mouth is often the seat \\nof the disease and the skin finally becomes wrinkled Administer a purga \\ntive and bathe the parts with a saturated solution of boracic acid lotion \\nnonpoisonous \\n\\nEczema â€” This is not contagious and in this respect differs from \\nmange which is It is a constitutional trouble and no external application \\nalone will ever cure it and you simpy waste time and medicine giving ex \\nternal treatment alone for to insure a cure of this disease internal and \\nexternal treatment both are required Neither must you expect to cure \\nit up in a short time which you ran do in mange for eczema requires time \\nand patience on your part â€” and the proper treatment The blood must he \\npurified and you know that if you yourself were taking a spring medicine \\nfor a general cleaning out and getting your blood in the right condition \\nyou would not expect to do it on one single bottle of Dr Somebodys Sarsa \\nparilla Eczema requires a proper course of medicine but can be cured In \\nthis disease the hair sacks or follicles are the principal seat of the dis3ase \\nbecoming inflamed and if the animal is a white one the hair assumes a \\nrusty or reddish color at the roots The inside of the thighs back of the \\nforelegs Hie elbows and belly art the parts first affected Prompt means \\nmust be taken at this tinr to check it up or inflammation increases rapidly \\nand the entire skin and subcutaneous tissues will be involved the hair \\ndrops out from the affected follicle purulent matter exudes and pustules \\nform which break open the matter from them running together and form \\ning scabs which crack open and bleed and the animal has become a pitiful \\nand loathsome object emitting a very disagreeable odor \\n\\nIn my forty years experience in handling dogs I have found at least \\nfifty cases of eczema to one of mange Any skin trouble appearing on a \\ndog the first conclusion of so many is that it is mange and here is where \\nthe mistake often comes in Eczema is curable in a dog the same as in \\na human but patience and regular persistent treatment must be expected \\nto be given the patient \\n\\n In every article on eczema given herein Eberharts Skin Cure will do \\nthe work externally and nothing more certain to use for the external part \\nof the treatment in lieu of any others advised in either of the articles It \\nis also safe and nonpoisonous \\n\\nIt will require a month or even two or three months treatment to effect \\na cure in eczema but if you follow treatment and keep it up faithfully you \\n\\n\\nwill surely be rewarded for your trouble by again seeing your dog as lie \\nshould be â€” in his usual good health and condition \\n\\nA couple years ago I found out something new to use internally for \\nthe blood in connection with my skin remedy externally A pure white \\nsulphur only obtainable of a homeopathic druggist and is called â€” Sulphur \\n12X I succeeded in curing up several cases of chronic eczema that I had \\nfailed with before One was a Chow Chow a longcoated dog that was \\nalmost bare of hair using the skin remedy once a day well rubbed in with \\nthe hands and giving him morning and night mixed in his food as it is \\ntasteless as much as would hold on a silver dime Sometimes I gave it \\ndry by opening mouth and dropping it well back on his tongue mornings \\nwhen his breakfast was dry Spratts dog cakes This dogs coat came out \\nfull this part mostly due to my skin remedy which is a hair grower If \\nno homeopathic druggist in your town your druggist can order it for you \\nor you can get it from me I consider this valuable treatment for eczema \\nas so far it has not failed to cure \\n\\nIf your dog has skin trouble find out whether it is eczema or one \\nof the several kinds of mange see Mange also \\n\\nThe following on eczema written by Dr F Holmes Brown is an able \\narticle on this subject \\n\\nEczema in the dog manifests many of the same signs and symptoms \\nof the same disease found in man No disease in the whole range of skin \\ndiseases is so difficult to treat properly In eczema in the dog it is especially \\nimportant that one first of all find out what is causing the disease then \\nseek to remove it In that way only can we hope for success \\n\\nEczema is an acute or chronic catarrhal inflammatory disease of the \\nskin In the dog it manifests itself in two separate and distinct forms first \\nthe blotch or nervous or neurotic form and second the red mange or irri \\ntative form The lesions in this disease vary according to the acting cause \\nthe seat of the disease and the care given the dog The blotch or neurotic \\nform attaclfs the skin on the head and along the back This form is similar \\nto the milk crust found in children and li due to much the same causes \\nThe red mange is that form in which the skin is generally red but it is \\nmore visible under the legs on the back and abdomen \\n\\nThe usual form of eruption in canine eczema cinsists of a large num \\nber of small water pimples or vesicles frequently covering a large extent \\nof skin These are formed close together forming quite large water blis \\nters When opened these look cellular in structure from the many small \\npimples of which they are composed They terminate either by absorption \\nor rupture They come in crops and remain for varying periods of time \\nAll dogs are liable to attacks of this disease Eczema becomes chronic \\nafter repeated attacks When we have a subdued form there is a greater \\ntendency to crusting and in severe cases to the formation of pus In the \\nblotch lack of exercise constipation overfeeding injurious foods and \\nindigestion are the main causes In the red mange form lack of assimila \\ntion rheumatism gout and external irritation as lice and ticks act as \\ncauses In both of these forms lack of exercise is one of the most impor \\ntant causes This results in an overheated blood surcharged with the \\npartly assimilated food and in nature seek3 to get rid of this excess of \\neffete material by the skinf \\n\\nThis is carried off by the exudation This is a law of nature when \\nthe ordinary channels are clogged to try and excrete these substances \\nthrough the skin This is particularly so in cases due to rheumatism where \\nnature seeks to rid the system of the excess of uric acid and urates These \\nsubstances act as direct irritants to the skin and set up a catarrhal inflam \\nmation Washing dogs affected with eczema is to be avoided as much as \\npossible as both water and soap act as a direct irritant to the already \\ninflamed skin The sulphate of magnesia or soda is in the beginning of \\ntreatment of great value When there is much constitutional disturbance \\nopium and calomel in grain closes are indicated Benzoated oxide of zinc \\nointment in the milder forms is of great benefit Tincture of arnica 15 \\nto 20 grains to the ounce of an oily lotion is of value Lotions contain \\ning salol or salicylic acid from five to thirty grains to the ounce resorcin \\nin the same proportion Dusting powders composed of acetanilid salol \\nsalicylic acid or resorcin with sterate of zinc as a base is of value When \\ndisease is due to debility mineral tonics and cod liver oil should be given \\nWhen the disease becomes chronic stronger remedies must be used oint \\nments containing juniper tar green soap and sulphur are of value The \\nointment of the nitrate and ammoniate of mercury are much used In \\ncases where the skin is especially sensitive silver nitrate 1 grain to the \\nounce of water will often effect a cure In the chronic cases especially \\niron arsenic calomel and quinine are to be used The animal while under \\ngoing treatment should be kept clean and give plenty of exercise An \\neruption resembling eczema may be induced by large doses of mercury \\nThe skin becomes red and swollen then forms large scales and hardens \\nThis eruption is generally limited to the limbs and scrotum Some of the \\nsymptoms are salivation loss of appetite eyelids closed dullness offensive \\nodor from the skin and rarely death \\n\\nI now give you Dents article on Eczema written expressly for thia \\nbook \\n\\nIn medical nomenclature eczema is a very comprehensive term It \\nis applied to all diseases of the skin except true mange or dog itch and \\non account of the irritation set up during an attack of mange it is generally \\ncomplicated with eczema which remains to annoy the dog and his owner \\nlong after the mange mites are destroyed \\n\\nDogs are particularly subject to skin diseases that are the bane \\nalike of the breeder keeping a large number of dogs in kennels or the \\nsingle house pet While true dog itch is common enough ninety per cent \\nof all skin diseases are eczema \\n\\nThere is a close relation between the skin of the dog and his digestive \\norgans and a deranged stomach will quickly find expression through an \\neruption of the skin any poverty or plethoric condition of the blood will \\nalso be expressed in the same way If there is any defect or unhealthy \\ncondition of the digestive tract and it is called upon to digest unsuitable \\nfood it is only a question of time before poisons are introduced into the \\nblood that will produce inflammation and eruptions of the skin Strictly \\nspeaking eczema is an inflammation of the skin due to the causes above \\nmentioned and numerous others such as old dirty damp bedding lack of \\nexercise overfeeding starvation irritation from insects lice fleas or from \\n\\n\\ntrue mange In most cases it can be ascribed to a disordered condition of \\nthe blood and general system \\n\\nEczema assumes a variety of forms In one very common form there \\nis first a redness of the entire skin with a dry scaly dandruff that flakes \\noff In another form there is an eruption of small distinct pimples or \\npapules that do not always break but can be easily felt like shot under \\nthe skin In another form there is a formation of scurvy crusts of a yel \\nlowish white color that smells like mice and underneath this crust are \\nsmall cupshaped ulcers \\n\\nFollicular mange or red mange is due to a sort of vegetable fungoid \\nmite that lives at the base of the hair and around the sebaceus gland \\nIt turns the skin a sort of brownish red kills the hair root and is most \\ncommonly found along the back near the root of the tail \\n\\nIn the commonest form of eczema there will first be noticed a patch \\non some part of the dogs body that is inflamed or covered with pimples \\nThese pimples increase in size and become a vesicle filled with a clear tur \\nbulent or purulent fluid This sore breaks the fluid escapes runs over \\nthe skin which it irritates and dries into scabs which mat the hair together \\nThe inflammation affects the hair follicle the hair drops out leaving bare \\nspots and there is a constant exudate of matter which spreads and forms \\nmore hare spots The skin becomes ulcerated or thickened and wrinkled \\nThe dog is tormented by the intolerable itching past all point of endur \\nance scratches himself until he bleeds cannot sleep or eat gets no rest \\nand becomes a mere wreck of his former self \\n\\nTreatment â€” As previously stated eczema and inflammation of the \\nskin are largely due to constitutional causes and there is no specific treat \\nment or radical cure for all cases and the owner must exercise his power \\nof judgment and reason and possibly try two or three different preparations \\nbefore effecting a cure \\n\\nThe following course must be pursued First make a change in the \\nanimals diet if he is being fed on grains and vegetables with little or no \\nmeat give him an increased amount of meat both lean and raw with little \\nor no bread or vegetables and vice versa If the dog is fat and plethoric \\ngenerally prosperous and inclined to be constipated give him a good laxa \\ntive pill every night and fast for twentyfour hours If he is thin and un \\nthrifty give cod liver oil emulson with from two to five grains of the \\nsulphate or iron of Sergeants Iron and Arsenic Pills The fat plethoric \\ndog should have a blood purifying and cooling pill twice a day for some \\ntime Claytons Blood Cooling Pill is very good or the following prescrip \\ntion \\n\\nFlower of sulphur 2 ounces \\n\\nCream of tartar 3 ounces \\n\\nBromide of potassium 3 drams \\n\\nMix and divide into eighteen powders and give one in the morning \\n\\nThe blood purifying and cooling pills mentioned are th best thing \\nto use handy and easier to give \\n\\n\\nf \\n\\nBesides the mange and eczema cures on the market the following \\nare useful in cases where there is great irritation with little or no eruption \\n\\nPlumbi acet dram \\n\\nSoda bibarat 1 drams \\n\\nGlycerin 2 ounces \\n\\nAqua camphor 8 ounces \\n\\nLanolin 4 ounces \\n\\nLard 4 ounces \\n\\nSalicylic acid 1 ounce \\n\\nBoracic acid 1 ounce \\n\\nApply once a day and wash every week and repeat \\n\\nAnother is \\n\\nCarbolized glycerin 1 ounce \\n\\nLaudanum 2 ounces \\n\\nCarbonate of potash 2 drams \\n\\nApply all over twice a day wash twice a week \\n\\nAnother is \\n\\nBoracic acid 1 ounce \\n\\nSalicyclic acid 1 ounco \\n\\nLaudanum 1 ounce \\n\\nWhale oil 14 ounces \\n\\nApply all over twice a day and wash once a week with Eberharts \\nSoap \\n\\nThe Kennelman has this to say of Eczema published in American \\nStockKeeper \\n\\nObstinate cases of eczema are most distressingly aggravating to the \\nkennel owner In a majority of instances this condition arises from the \\ncontinued use of starchy foods When I he symptoms appear â€” pustulous \\nformations at the roots af the hair after a preliminary redness of the \\nskin and wet oozy sores that appear to the size of a half dollar in a night \\nthe diet should be attended to Lean raw meat must be fed almost ex \\nclusively Then the blood must be purified and exercise given freely A \\nhandy preparation that will be found excellent as a general cleanser and \\npreventive is a mixture of equal parts not weights of Epsom salts cream \\nof tartar and sulphur lac a pinch every morning in quantity according \\nto the size of the dog dropped on the tongue for a week will do good \\nIt is a remedial agent that is useful at any time In bad chronic cases \\nthis mixture will do well â€” one drop of fluid extract of colchicum and five \\ngrains of sulphate of soda three times daily in a capsule feed raw beef \\nand no cereal food Apply to the sores equal parts of oil of tar and alcohol \\nor Eberharts Skin Cure \\n\\nAnother good thing is the liver of sulphur one buys in pound tins \\n\\n\\nn diseases \\n\\nSulph Potass Dissolve a teaspoonful in a quart of warm water and \\napply at once to the sores in fact the whole body should be covered with \\nit If a dip is required for several dogs make the solution of the above \\nproportions if too strong the hair will be burned off This is a won \\nderfully good remedy for puppy rash that develops often after puppies \\nleave the mother and if the puppy licks itself all the better \\n\\nFatness Excessive â€” This should never exist in any dog and need not \\nproviding it has been fed properly and sufficiently exercised It is a hard \\nthing to do to reduce a dog especially an old one after it has been allowed \\nto get into this condition However some dogs are predisposed to obesity \\nand to put on fat even when on a meagre diet such being the case with \\na great many pugs and different species of spaniels A certain amount of \\nfat is not only a sign of health but also desirable as it is the store of fuel \\nthat nature lays up to meet future exigencies but an excess of fat con \\nstitutes a morbid and diseased state of the body \\n\\nA common effect of excessive fat is to set up skin disease with dis \\ncharge therefrom which is Natures means of ridding the system of the \\nsuperfluous matter Or the fat accumulates round vital organs interfering \\nwith the animals respiration making the breathing labored wheezy and \\nasthamatical painful to the sufferer which blows and pants on the slightest \\nextra exertion and most distressing to the owner In bitches not allowed \\nto breed fat accumulates round the kidneys and ovaries the heart also \\nbecomes surrounded with fat and what is called fatty infiltration or fatty \\ndegeneration ensues which may cause sudden death \\n\\nCauses â€” It is caused by confinement lack of exercise and an over \\nabundance of food of too rich a quality of fatproducing material Castrat \\ning of dogs and spaying of bitches â€” and I dont believe it right to do either \\nâ€” will cause accumulations of adipose matter as it takes from the dog \\none of the organs of secretion and all dogs that refuse sexual connection \\nwill become obese All dogs should be allowed Natures privilege at least \\na few times during their lives \\n\\nTreatment â€” Give a brisk purgative two or three times a week and \\ngive two to three grains of the iodide of potash in water twice a day after \\nfeeding Gradually decrease the allowance of food and feed only stale \\nbread dog biscuit or crackers dry if they will eat them if not moisten \\nwith a very little milk or thin soup do not feed grease fat potatoes or \\nsweets of any kind As the food is decreased slowly increase the amount \\nof exercise and as the animal gradually comes into form omit the purga \\ntives and feed raw lean beef chopped fine â€” gradually increasing the \\namount \\n\\nFleas â€” These are familiar to every one I mean the fleas that are \\nfound on dogs and no description is really necessary There are a number \\nof good remedies \\n\\nEberharts Dog Soap is the easiest and surest remedy for fleas of any \\nthing made and much less trouble to use All your dog needs is a good \\nshampoo with this soap swice twentyfour hours apart After applying it \\nthoroughly all over the dog not missing a spot or you leave some fleas \\n\\nthat will be heard from then rinse the dog in lukewarm water and dry \\nthoroughly with rough towels There is however nothing â€” unless you \\nwould keep some preparation on the dog all the time in summer â€” that \\nwill keep fleas off of a dog in case he comes in contact with them again as \\nhe may do if he meets another dog that has them when your dog is certain \\nto get a new supply If all his bedding is not destroyed while being \\ntreated or his sleeping box not thoroughly disinfected he will again get \\nmore fleas The best plan is to burn all the bedding he has used in his \\nsleeping box basket or kennel and then scrub it out with some good dis \\ninfectant getting into the cracks and corners with Standard Disinfectant \\nsee advertisement of the Standard Disinfectant Co which will do the \\nwork Fleas breed every twentyfour hours so that in using my soap you \\nmust give the second bath twentyfour hours later to destroy the young \\nones \\n\\nDogs which have dense long coats are subjects of special delight to \\nthe fleas The mouth of the flea is specially adapted for sucking the wings \\nare rudimentary being represented by four minute scales The lavse is \\na footless grub which in about twelve days spins a cocoon i e an \\nouter covering of silky hairs for itself and becomes a chrysalis from which \\nthe perfect flea emerges in about a fortnight more \\n\\nHere are also some homemade remedies that you can try â€” they will \\nall kill fleas â€” but my soap is so sure so pleasant to use and also so bene \\nficial to the coat that it seems foolish to try anything else One part of \\noil of cloves to 20 parts of methylated spirit Directions Apply all over \\nafter washing Or terebene 1 part glycerine 1 part methylated spirits \\n4

powders made both are very good to rid a dog \\nof fleas if you prefer a powder instead of a liquid remedy as is often de \\nsirable especially in cold weather to avoid the danger of dog catching \\ncold Dr Claytons see his advertisement will do the work if used \\nas directed The other one is Vermilax Flea Powder considered one \\nof the best made See the advertisement of Vermilax Co in this book \\nI carry this Flea Powder in stock and can send it by mail postpaid at \\nthirty cents a box \\n\\nFistula in Anusâ€” This is not uncommon in pampered and overfed \\ndogs and may be partial or complete It usually shows as an opening at \\nthe sides of the anus extending upwards to the gut where it can be seen \\nbut in some cases there is no external opening It is caused by consti \\npation when the hardened feces abrade the surface in its expulsion or \\nneglected piles resulting in ulceration or fistula of the anus may come \\nfrom a wound inflicted on the part \\n\\nSymptoms of Internal Fistula â€” The dog drags himself along the \\nground and the voided matter is highly offensive and often covered or \\n\\n\\nsystreaked with blood and matter The treatment should be left to the \\nveterinary surgeon who will lay the sinug open and apply remedies to \\nset up healthy action and close it up \\n\\nFlatulency â€” Is not very common in adult dogs but oftener met with \\nin puppies It is unmistakable evidence of indigestion For immediate \\nrelief the treatment should consist in giving to a 20 lb dog half a tea \\nspoonful of carbonate of magnesia large dogs a teaspoonful in a little \\nmilk or give a dose of castor oil and follow with 5 gr to 15 gr of \\ncarbonate of bismuth three times a day dry upon the tongue For per \\nmanent cure correct the indigestion See Indigestion \\n\\nForeign Bodies in the Intestines â€” This is another cause of obstruc \\ntion in the bowels to which dogs are peculiarly liable Pieces of bone are \\nswallowed of such size and substance that they pass through the diges \\ntive organs very slightly diminished and getting into the smaller intestines \\ncannot pass farther so that feces accumulate and harden until if not re \\nlieved inflammation is set up Sometimes stones are swallowed and cause \\nobstruction and this will at once demonstrate the danger of throwing \\nstones for dogs to retrieve for in their eagerness they are apt to swallow \\nthem especially if small Wool or rabbit fur swallowed is likely to ball \\ntogether with other matter See Obstruction of Bowels \\n\\nFalse Joint â€” Is found where limb was improperly set or the dog in \\nunhealthy condition It is the nonunion of the bone by the usual osseous \\ndeposits instead of which there is a fibrous connection the union of the \\nbones or portions of them is much like they had been united by a pice \\nof India rubber the two pieces of bone can be readiiy moved while the \\nlimb cannot support any weight An operation is often attempted to \\nset up inflammation of the parts and induce osserous or bony deposits but \\nexperience has proven such operations not very successful \\n\\nFatty Degeneration of the Heart â€” Previous to making a brief refer \\nence to this diseased state it is necessary to tell the reader a few points \\nof importance in connection with the healthy heart of the dog It is a \\nhollow muscular organ with a right and left compartment the ventricles \\nIn shape it is like a cone th apex of the cone pointing downwards and \\nbackwards The base is made up of two compartments of the body These \\nlarge vessels serve to suspend the heart in the chest cavity says Frank \\nTownsend Barton in British Fancier \\n\\nThe blood coming from these vessels first of all passes into the two \\ncompartments at the base auricles and from these through valves into \\nthe compartments first mentioned and called the ventricles \\n\\nThe weight of the heart varies according to breed and age but it \\nhas been estimated that it runs from 3 to 7 per cent of the weight of the \\nanimal It is enclosed in a bag pericardium When perfectly healthy \\nit should be dark red in color firm to the touch of the finger and the traces \\nof fat running down the various grooves upon its surface are a sign of a \\nwellnourished orgaa \\n\\nNow when it is affected by what is called fatty degeneration it be \\ncomes very pale thin and flabby greasy to the touch with one or more \\npatches of fat upon the walls of the ventricles This is brought about by \\nthe muscle fibres composing the heart being changed or replaced by fat \\n\\nIn order to bring about this condition the dog need not be fat itself \\nin fact a heart in this state is far more likely to be found in a dog which \\nis thin or underfed \\n\\nDogs which are excessively fat externaly generally show the same \\ninternally that is to say that the heart kidneys liver etc may be com \\npletely imbedded in one mass of fat but then it must be understood that \\nthis is not a diseased state and does not interfere with the animals health \\nso long as it allows these different organs to perform their work It is \\na sign of over rather than one of under nutrition \\n\\nThe fatty degenerated heart is a diseased one This is not technical \\nIt is called an infiltration a term which means that fat is formed be \\ntween the muscular fibres \\n\\nI am not aware that there is any symptom or symptoms during life \\nwhich will enable us to tell whether the heart is in this diseased state \\nAn opinion can only be purely speculative Of course the heart has a \\nweak beat and the animal is easily knocked out Sudden death is likely \\nto occur either from failure of the hearts action or if the fat is in the \\nform of a patch upon the wall from sudden rupture of the wall at this spot \\nwhereby the blood would gush suddenly out of the heart into the bag \\ncontaining it ceasing to beat at once \\n\\nThe animal must be prevented from any severe exertion \\nIt has been stated that this disease is common among pampered \\nasthmatical pets the truth of which is open to serious doubt \\n\\nThis is perhaps the most frequent form of heart disease found in the \\ndog it is however seldom diagnosed during life A postmortem will \\nshow in such cases that the fibres of the muscles are dotted with small \\ndark spots these are globules of oil within the sheath of the fibre the \\nheart tissue is soft and breaks down readily under the finger Cause may \\narise from a general malnutrition of the system or from senile decay due \\nto old age The organ not always wholly involved and when only a part \\nis affected it is due to some obstruction causing local malnutrition \\n\\nWarty Growths on the Valves of the Heart â€” The valves of the heart \\nare sometimes the seat of small wartlike growths When a dog has been \\na constant sufferer from rheumatism in such we occasionally meet with \\nthese growths Their presence may prevent the valves from working \\nproperly or one may be whipped off and thus block the circulation \\nSudden death may occur \\n\\nEvertion should be avoided as much as possible but this stite can \\nonly be surmised during life as in the case of the former disease \\n\\nFollicular Mange â€” See Mange \\n\\nFounder of the Chest â€” See Kennel Lameness \\n\\nFracture â€” See Bones Broken \\n\\n\\n82 âGastritis See Stomach Inflammation of \\n\\nGatherings â€” See Abscess and Boils \\n\\nGlass Eye â€” See Amaruosis \\n\\nGlossitis â€” See Tongue Inflammation of \\n\\nFractures â€” While fractures are not of frequent occurrence in well \\nordered kennels they belong to that category of accidents against which \\nthere is sometimes no safeguard A sudden twist stopping in some hid \\nden cavity while galloping over a field jumping a fence or from a car \\nriage one of the cleanest breaks of a hind leg occurred to a foxterrier \\nbitch of ours while jumping off the carriage seat and catching her hind \\nleg in the wire rail guard at the end of the seat so one never knows \\nwhen such accidents will happen Simple fractures are so termed when \\na bone is broken into two pieces only where a bone is broken into several \\npieces it is termed comminuted and when the ends of the broken bone \\npierce the skin it is a compound fracture which is the worst of all in the \\npiecing To detect a simple fracture is not always easy though of \\ncourse the other two conditions are more or less selfevident In the \\ncase of a simple fracture the limb should be taken hold of above the \\nbruise or injury with one hand and with the other gently move the lower \\nportion of the limb If the bone or bones are fractured a grating noise \\nwill be heard and the jar of the broken bone can be felt \\n\\nIn treating this condition great care must be exercised in bringing \\nthe broken ends together and it is best that the services of a surgeon be \\nprocured In case that is not available or a home cure is decided upon \\nthe ends of the fractured bones should be brought opposite each other \\nand then splints well secured by bandages must be applied to keep them \\nin their places until the two ends are joined This is generally from \\nthree to four weeks in the case of a puppy and from a month to six \\nweeks in a matured dog If the case is not attended to immediately after \\nthe accident the parts swell and this swelling has to be reduced before \\nany attempt can be made to set the bones and cold water or ice applied \\nto the swelling will easily reduce it Before applying the splints it is \\nnecessary to wind a bandage around the limb two or three times from \\nthe bottom to the top as this has the effect of preventing the splints \\nfrom causing unnecessary irritation The splints which are best made \\nof wood of about onesixteenth of an inch in thickness of sufficient length \\nto extend over the whole straight surface of the limb should be four in \\nnumber viz one for the front of the leg one for the back and one for \\neither side of it and they should be just wide enough to cover the part \\nof the leg on Which they are placed Before applying them the inside \\nof each should be smeared with hot pitch cobblers wax or some such \\n6ubstance so that they will adhere to the bandage and not slip and then \\nanother bandage which should be of considerable length about six yards \\nlong and one inch and a half to two inches wide and which has been \\npreviously soaked in a thick solution of gum or common starch should be \\n\\nwound round the limb from bottom to top The object of the starch or \\ngum solution is to give additional support which it does when it gets stiff \\nand hardens After the operation the dog should be put into a quiet place \\nâ€” a large hamper or crate does very well â€” so that he can rest and not \\nmove about but it often happens that the next day the part of the limb \\nbelow the bandage is found to be swollen if so the latter should be \\nloosened for a short time but it must be tightened again when the swell \\ning subsides \\n\\nThe above treatment is of course only advised in the case of simple \\nfractures where an amateur may indulge his surgical skill \\n\\nFits â€” Dalziel so fully and ably handles this subject that I give his \\narticle entire as it covers the whole ground I have been governed by \\nhis ideas in treating many cases and the success I had leads me to endorse \\nhis treatment \\n\\nFits are of common occurrence especially in puppies â€” fortunately \\nthose that are of a dangerous and fatal character are the most rare they \\noften cause needless alarm but the dog suffering from a fit of whatever \\nkind is not an object to be frightened at but to be commiserated and \\nhelped and this requires freedom from a fear for which there is no just \\nreason Fits are of many kinds and may be classified as apoplectic fits \\ndistemper fits fits from teething fits from worms and suckling fits and \\nother causes of excitement are known to produce them even high notes \\nof music to which some dogs show a strong objection and are decidedly \\nharmful \\n\\nApoplectic Fits are caused by pressure on the brain from distended \\nbloodvessels or effusions of blood The subjects of attack are generally \\nthose dogs that are kept in idleness and overfed and the attack may be \\nthe result of the animal overloading the stomach with food difficult of \\ndigestion The symptoms are loud labored breathing the dog lies mo \\ntionless on its side in a state of insensibility â€” there is no frothing at \\nthe mouth or champing of the jaws but the eyes are fixed and often blood \\nshot Such cases are usually fatal and death is frequently instantan \\neous Prompt bleeding is the most likely means of saving the patient \\nand then soon as sufficiently recovered a strong purge should be given \\nor clysters administered Should these means prove successful it will \\nbe necessary to use extreme care to prevent a recurrence of the fit The \\ndogs diet must be carefully regulated sufficient healthful exercise al \\nlowed or compelled if need be and occasional doses of cooling medicine \\ngiven Claytons or Dents Blood Cooling Pills will be just the thing to \\ngive Apoplexy in the dog is not often seen in practice \\n\\nDistemper Fits are caused by congestion or inflammation of the brain \\nand often prove fatal \\n\\nEpileptic Fits are not dangerous but of very common occurrence \\nespecially during the heated term and generally happen when the dog is \\nat exercise â€” sometimes in the case of pointers they are seized when on \\n\\n\\nthe point doubtless from the undue excitement produced When the \\ndog is attacked he is first observed to tremble on his legs and on trying \\nto run on he staggers and falls down on his side frequently uttering a \\nlow moan Struggling to his feet he attempts to move only to repeat the \\nfall when he lies stupefied and insensible The legs and the whole mus \\ncular system are violently convulsed the clog froths at the mouth the \\nhead is violently moved often knocked against the ground the jaws are \\nchamped together and sometimes the tongue gets lacerated between the \\nteeth and the froth from his mouth becomes tinged with blood the \\nbreathing during the fit is labored and irregular The fit generally lasts \\nseveral minutes When the convulsions have subsided the dog raises \\nhis head opens his eyes with a look ofsurprise and very shortly runs \\nabout as if nothing had happened \\n\\nThe treatment during an epileptic fit is to generally carry the dog to \\na dry place where there is some soft material so that he cannot hurt \\nhimself in his struggles As soon after as possible give him a dose of \\nAntispasmodic Drops Compound spirits of sulphuric ether known as \\nHoffmans anodyne and tincture of opium laudanum equal parts \\nKeep well corked and cool Dose for 15 to 35 lb dog would be a \\nteaspoonful in two tablespoonfuls of milk Larger dogs nearly a dessert \\nspoonful as a dose â€” and leave him quiet in a warm comfortable kennel \\nEndeavor to ascertain the cause of the fit If from overfeeding reduce \\nthe diet and give gentle exercise and if need be repeated doses of cool \\ning medicine 3 gr of bromide of potash for a 20 lb to 40 lb clog twice \\na clay in water for a week will be beneficial to dogs predisposed to epi \\nlepsy \\n\\nSuckling Fits are produced by exhaustion consequent on the bitch \\nhaving too many pups left on her She lies or falls down breathing heavily \\nbecomes insensible and is frequently much convulsed Remove all the \\npups but one or two which must meanwhile be fed on the bottle or by \\nspoon condensed milk â€” a little at a time but often â€” and let the mother \\nhave a generous diet and if much reduced give Claytons or Dents Con \\ndition Pills for a week or so \\n\\nFits from Distemper The following is from the American Field \\n\\nand is prescribed for by Dent their veterinarian \\n\\nI have an English setter bitch twenty months old which has dis \\ntemper I thought her about over it when a few days ago she had a fit â€ \\nwhich lasted about 3 minutes she got up and seemed scared had a wild \\nlook in her eyes and seemed unable to see well She has those fits now \\nonce or twice a day and is very weak but eats well though hardly able to \\nstand up The fits she has now are of shorter duration but she seems \\nmuch weaker just after one she has a fit soon after she begins to eat \\nand is disturbed every morning after she gets over it she will finish her \\nbreakfast of soup and rice or milk Will she necessarily die or is she \\nincurable I have had a good deal of experience with distemper and \\nhave lost eight fourmonthsold puppies this Fall but I have never lost \\nany as old as this one Ansâ€” Give twenty grains of the bromide of soda \\n\\nand onethirtieth of a grain of arsenic three times a day w think she \\nwill recover \\n\\nTeething Fits often occur during the cutting of the first teeth but \\nmore frequently when the permanent ones are being irrupted Lancing the \\ngums is sometimes resorted to but as a rule a little opening medicine is all \\nthat is needed Convulsions are frequently present in these fits as also in \\nthose due to worms \\n\\nFits Due to Worms â€” When these parasites are the producing cause \\nthat fact may be ascertained by examining the fasces voided during or just \\nafter the fit as some of them will probably be seen Or the presence of \\nworms may be determined by the symptoms given under that head and \\nto Worms you are referred \\n\\nFeet Sore â€” Dogs that travel very much sporting dogs that hunt \\nover rough ground or short stubble are apt to get the pads of the feet \\ncontused and worn thin \\n\\nTreatment depends on extent of the injury If feet are only tender \\nand slightly inflamed bathe with cold water afterward applying freely \\nthe following lotion \\n\\nTincture of arnica Vs ounce \\n\\nTincture of matico Vz ounce \\n\\nTincture of opium 1 ounce \\n\\nAcetic acid ounce \\n\\nWater enough to till a wine bottle \\n\\nIn severe cases apply a poultice of half bran and half boiled turnips \\nIf the inflammation is great and the feet become swollen hot and pain \\nful so that the dog cannot stand the general health suffers as fever \\nishness and loss of appetite will reduce his strength matter will form \\nin his feet or perhaps his soles will slough off \\n\\nIn such extreme cases add linseed meal to the other ingredients and \\npour a little olive oil over its surface The dog should have a mild aperient \\nand a dose of the following fever mixture \\n\\nPowdered nitre 1 dram \\n\\nSweet spirits of nitre ounce \\n\\nMindererus spirits 1 V2 ouncs \\n\\nWine of antimony 1 dram \\n\\nWater 4 ounces \\n\\nDose for a 30 lb to 50 lb dog would be a tablespoonful every four hours in \\na little gruel \\n\\nDog should be kept on a light diet Sometimes for more speedy relief \\nit is well to let the water out with a lancet and in all respects these cases \\nshould be treated as ulcers \\n\\n\\nâGoitre or Bronchocelc â€” This term is applied to a swelling or lump \\nthat appears on the front part of the neck known as the thyroid gland \\nIt is soft and elastic to the touch and appears to give no pain except when \\ntreatment is neglected and it increases to such a size as to interfere with \\nthe breathing It is especially a disease of old dogs although it often \\noccurs in illfed and scrofulous puppies If will appear in a night and is \\nsometimes due to a cold caught which settles in the glands of the throat \\nThe latest and I have found by having to treat many cases is Iodin Vasigin \\nfull strength which apply twice daily rubbing well in with the hands as \\nyou would apply a liniment Another good remedy to apply same as aboce \\nis Iodidode of Potassium one dram to seven ounces of lard well mixed \\nAside from external treatment give cod liver oil â€” from a teaspoonful for \\na 20 lb dog up to two tablespoonfuls for a dog like a pointer or St \\nBernard three times a day If abscesses form they must be lanced Dogs \\nsuffering from Goitre should be extra well fed Painting with tincture of \\niodine one a day is as good as anything you can do \\n\\nGatherings â€” See Abscesses \\n\\nGastritis â€” Symptoms very pronounced in the acute form first vom \\niting pain and tenderness The position of the animal is often charac \\nteristic The animal lies stretched out on his belly There is not the same \\ntendency to arched back as in colic \\n\\nHere is another old fashioned remedy that I have found most suc \\ncessful Get a dimes worth of Slippery Elm bark cut it up pour a quart \\nof water over it then set it in another vessel of water and boil till it \\nmakes an emulsion like mucilage Give dog a tablespoonful small toys \\nhalf this three times a day before feeding Feed light soft foods for \\na few days Milk peptonized is very good \\n\\nIf there is constipation Enemas must be given \\n\\nWater must be given sparingly only a small quantity at a time and \\nquite cold \\n\\nGleet â€” Blaine gives this name to a discharge from the prepuce but \\nit appears to

irregular and feeble A postmortem will show the \\nvalves thickened and may present upon their surfaces granulations which \\nfeel under the finger like minute particles of sand Treatment is of no \\navail but to prevent sudden death all undue excitement should be avoided \\n\\nHarvest Bugs â€” These come in summer and are sometimes but not \\noften troublesome to dogs as well as man They burrow in the skin as \\n\\ndoes the parasite in mange Eberharts Skin Cure applied twice a day as \\nin mange will soon destroy them \\n\\nHaematuria Bloody Urine â€” Dogs have this trouble being the re \\nsult of calculi situated in the bladder kidney or urethra Irritation and \\ninflammation are caused by these foreign bodies and also injure the mu \\ncous membrane producing abrasions and superficial bleeding the blood \\nbeing passed with the urine A blow across the back may also cause it \\nUpon pressing the dogs loins pain is evinced and there is also a certain \\namount of irritation caused by passing the urine Blood is sometimes \\nmixed with the latter or it may be passed independently of it Give 10 \\nto 60 drops of liquid extract of ergot every four hours and if the urinary \\npassage is the seat of the injury inject a weak solution of Condys Fluid \\nThe food should consist for a time of Bovine or beef tea with egg and \\nmilk to drink Under no circumstances administer a diuretic \\n\\nHepatitis Inflammation of the Liver â€” See Jaundice \\n\\nHernia Umbilical â€” See Navel Hernia \\n\\nHiccough arises from indigestion and often annoys house pets that \\nare given improper food such as sweets etc A wineglassful of lime wa \\nter in a tumbler of milk to drink and for a 20 lb dog 10 grains of bicar \\nbonate of soda and 10 drops of sal volatile in a tablespoonful of milk will \\nusually prove effectual Another remedy I have used is camplior water \\nnot spirits Give a 20 to 40 lb dog a teaspoonful and repeat in five \\nminutes \\n\\nHusk â€” Dogs are subject to a dry husky cough associated with de \\nrangement of the stomach and worms are often the originating cause \\nThe symptoms are dry hot nose disagreeable breath inflamed eye and \\nincreased discharge from nose with more or less general fever the dog \\nafter coughing retches bringing up portions of frothy mucus The treat \\nment consists in keeping the dog free from damp and cold feeding on \\nwarm easily digested food and the administration of a dose of salad oil \\nevery third morning and the following two sets of pills two a day of each \\ngiving alternately \\n\\nPills for Husky Cough â€” Powdered opium 6 grains tartarised anti \\nmony 1 grain compound squill pill 1 dram mix and divide into twenty \\nfour pills and give one to a 20 lb dog twice a day \\n\\nTonic Stomachic Pills â€” Pure Sulphate of iron 12 grains dried bicar \\nbonate of soda 24 grains extract of camomile 24 grains mix and divide \\ninto twelve pills One of these is a dose for a 20 lb dog Not infrequently \\nworms in the stomach will cause husk if so a full dose of ipecacuanha wine \\nto cause vomiting should be given \\n\\nAs I am writing I have just had such a case of a dry hard and in \\ncessant cough in an eightmonthsold bull terrier pup which cough sud \\ndenly appeared without any apparent cause the dog acting and seeming \\nwell only for this dry hard cough She had been fully as I supposed at \\n\\n\\n88 vthe time treated for worms and thought she was rid of them but could \\nnot account for the cough I was ou the lookout and seen her have a \\npassage of a bloody and mucous nature Toward night I concluded it \\nmight be worms gave her a dose of Sergeants Sure Shot after she had \\nfasted from breakfast till supper time and the result was â€” finding several \\nsmall thread worms in her passage after the vermifuge had worked and \\nhere was the cause of the dry hard cough I followed this up the next \\nmorning with a second dose of Sure Shot got more thread worms and \\nthe bitch feeling much better wanting to eat and her cough very much \\nbetter She fully recovered All this goes to show that you must get \\nrid of the Worms â€” as they are the cause of more trouble to dogs than from \\nany other cause or a combined lot of causes you may as truthfully say \\n\\nHonie Sickness â€” This is often seen in dogs which from some causa \\nor other have to leave their home and friends and reside for a time in a \\nhospital It therefore behooves every one who has charge of such dogs to \\nmake them comfortable and treat them as nearly as possible consistent \\nwith rational and medical treatment as they would be at home It is \\nabsolutely cruel to place a nervous and highly sensitive pet dog in a kennel \\nsurrounded by other dogs which are continually barking or to give them \\nover entirely to an attendant which is too frequently done in hospitals \\nthe owner of the establishment or the veterinary surgeon only attending \\nat intervals All pets should be taken into the house or have a special \\nplace set apart for them where they can receive personal attention and have \\ntheir small comforts attended to \\n\\nVery much the best plan is to not send your pet to any veterinary \\nhospital but to keep it home where it will much better endure the ordeal \\nit may have to go through and have the surgeon come there to treat it \\n\\nThe dog will be happier in his own home where it will receive aside \\nfrom the treatment of the doctor the kind care and attention it could not \\nget in a strange place among strangers and strange surroundings \\n\\nHookworms â€” The process by which the hookworm reaches the intes \\ntines is most interesting The egg or embryo is deposited in fecal matter \\nwithin the intestines It hatches or develops after being exposed to air \\nand moisture usually within twelve to twentyfour hours if the tempera \\nture is above seventy or eighty degrees Fahrenheit In about eight days \\nunder favorable conditions such as being on warm wet ground it attains \\nfull growth microscopically and is ready to infest which it does by boring \\nthrough the skin or mucous membrane of the mouth into the blood canals \\nand is carried along with the blood currents to the lungs then it bores \\nthrough the walls of the blood canals into the air sacs and crawls up \\nthrough the windpipe to the throat and then passes directly to the in \\ntestines either by crawling or being swallowed with food or water attaches \\nitself to intestinal membranes and begins a life which lasts from six to \\nten years unless expelled It subsists entirely upon the blood which it \\nsucks After it is attached it grows to a length of onethird to onehalf \\ninch the female being somewhat larger than the male as shown in illus \\ntration She is very prolific and one dog which is infested will pollute a \\n\\nvast area of ground by reason of rains washing or spreading the feces \\ncontaining thousands of eggs or embryos \\n\\nThe presence of hookworm is hard almost impossible to detect with \\nout the use of a microscope unless the investment is quite heavy then \\nrapid decline is noticed such as general weakness or paralysis of the legs \\nor hindquarters \\n\\nSymptoms â€” Rough hair sometimes a cough as a rule the appetite \\ncontinues fairly good languid eyes become bloodless and listless gums \\npale generally a creamy white Excretion sometimes natural again loose \\nagain of a dysentery nature frequently a little drop of blood or two This \\nmay be examined by the average layman many times with the naked eye \\nand from the fact that he doesnt see any the conclusion is arrived at \\nthat the dog is free of hookworm Many times a dog in apparently the \\nbest of health is infected with these terrible pests his strong constitu \\ntion overbalancing the damage that Mr Worm is doing This wont last \\nalways and sooner or later he will pay the price \\n\\nWhile a microscopical examination will reveal the eggs it occasionally \\nhappens that the worm itself is shown in feces under certain conditions \\nOf course a microscopic examination of the feces for the ova is the one \\nabsolute certain way of determining a dog having them \\n\\nThis worm has been discovered in dogs cats foxes badgers and \\nhuman beings adults as well as children This is mentioned with the \\nview to impress upon all interested the necessity of being alive to the \\ntrue situation in order to prevent the scattering of the disease and to \\nshow the chances of it being scattered \\n\\nThe worm attaches itself to the walls of the intestine and lives about \\nseven years Remember kennel owners the worm does not incubate in \\nthe intestine but simply deposits its thousands of eggs there which are \\npassed out on the ground in the excrement I have dissected sixweek \\nold puppies and found many hookworms This was no doubt brought \\nabout by the dam lying out on the ground her teats being attacked by \\nthe freshly hatched worm and brought to the suckling puppies They were \\ntreated in the ordinary way for worms but this will not kill hookworms \\n\\nIf hookworm is found in one dog in the kennel it is safe to assume \\nevery dog in the kennel is infected and should be treated \\n\\nThe following most valuable article is from The American Field writ \\nten by Edward Martin M R C V S \\n\\nUntil quite recently hookworm disease in the dog also known as \\npernicious anemia uncinariasis etc has been but slightly recognized This \\nis probably owing to neglect on the part of owners of dogs and veterin \\narians to make careful postmortem examinations and again to the fact \\nthat young dogs infected with hookworm generally carry round worms and \\ntapeworms and it is to the effects of these that death when it occurs is \\nattributed \\n\\nThe hookworm parasite technically known as Uncinaria inhabitsthe \\nsmall intestines of dogs and foxes When mature they attach themselves \\nto the mucous membrane and live entirely on the blood they extract For \\nthe purposes of this article they may be described as an extremely fine \\nround worm white or grayish in color from onethird to seveneighths of \\nan inch in length and about as thick as a fine sewing needle As they can \\n\\n\\nseldom be seen in the stools it may be advisable to describe their appear \\nance on postmortem examination of their host \\n\\nDogs dying from this disease are generally emaciated and when the \\npatient has lingered long covered with bedsores The gums are pale often \\nspongy and ulcerated the teeth covered with a dark green deposit with a \\npronounced odor On opening the abdomen the mesenteric glands are \\ngenerally found to be enlarged and dark in color due to irritation set up \\nby the poisonous products of the parasites The outer surface of the stom \\nach and bowels as a rule show little or no changes in aggravated cases \\nthere may be a few dark red or purple spots \\n\\nTo find the parasites the stomach and bowels should be taken out and \\nslit up The parasite does not often occur in the stomach but may be \\nfound firmly attached to the wall in any part of the small intestines The \\nmucous membrane of the intestines should be examined in a good light \\ninch by inch with a magnifying glass and if necessary washed with run \\nning water to clear away mucus partly digested food etc \\n\\nThe parasite can be recognized curled up in a spiral or lying straight in \\ngroups of four or five to a dozen They may be evenly distributed through \\nout the small intestine If the examination be made shortly after death \\neach parasite is found firmly attached in the center of a red inflamed spot \\nwherever the contents of the bowels are cherry colored from blood staining \\nthe parasites can be found most numerously The whole of the small \\nintestine is as a rule inflamed and thickened In many cases round worms \\nand tapeworms are also present especially in young dogs \\n\\nSymptoms and Diagnosis of the Disease \\n\\nHookworm disease has been looked on as essentially a disease of sport \\ning dogs especially hounds As a matter of fact all breeds are equally sus \\nceptible and it is simply due to the fact that sporting dogs are generally \\nraised and kept where the conditions favor the parasites that it has been \\nso considered Dogs at all ages are liable to become infected but grow \\ning puppies from a few weeks to a year old are more susceptible to the \\neffects of the worms \\n\\nSymptoms are unfortunately indefinite in the majority of cases The \\ndog may show signs of worms and with treatment pass round worms and \\ntapeworms but fails to pick up and develop as expected Young puppies \\nbecome anemic with pallid gums distended abdomen injected eyes and \\na hot dry nose The usual treatment with vermifuges and purgatives \\nproduces a persistent diarrhea the worm toxins produce convulsions coma \\nand death in a very few days Older dogs from six to twelve months old \\npass through these stages more slowly \\n\\nThe appetite is capricious or voracious the gums become spongy and \\nbleed easily to the touch development of teeth is arrested â€” in several \\ncases I have observed crumbling of the enamel due to faulty assimilation \\nof the necessary constituents and to the presence of a foulsmelling green \\ndeposit Chorea may develop suddenly and progresses in violence until \\ndeath occurs In the course of time diarrhea sets in which increases in \\nseverity until bloodstained or tarrylooking movements occur several times \\n\\nin the hour Rapid emaciation exhaustion and death follow in a few days \\nonce dysentery is established \\n\\nAbsolute diagnosis can only be made by microscopical examinations \\nof the stools This however involves considerable technical difficulties \\nand for practical purposes may be counted out \\n\\nTreatment \\n\\nIn nursing and newly weaned puppies is almost out of the question as \\ndrastic remedies cannot be used safely The remedies recommended by \\ngovernment experts for uncinariasis in man are thymol male fern oil of \\nturpentine and chloroform singly or in combination followed by active \\npurgatives In the dog it is advisable to give all vermifuge medicines in \\ncapsules or coated pills to prevent nausea and vomiting which occurs when \\nmedicines are given in fluid form In the dog better results are produced \\nby giving daily doses before feeding each morning In this way dysentery \\nis not so liable to be set up as where full treatments are given \\n\\nThymol is looked on as a specific in the human being but is a most \\nunreliable drug for the dog In a number of puppies of the same age weight \\n and condition I have found some who would tolerate large doses while in \\nothers extremely small doses would produce persistent vomiting convul \\nsions and death Extract of male fern in combination with turpentine \\nchloroform and castor oil or glycerine is much safer given in small daily \\ndoses \\n\\nDuring treatment tonics such as iron arsenic and strychnine arsenite \\nof copper etc should be given and to sustain strength cod liver oil raw \\nmeat and milk and eggs should be fed generously To control diarrhea \\nbismuth subgallate may be given in large doses it acts as an intestinal \\nantiseptic as well as being an astringent \\n\\nAs a tonic instead of drugs given in this article the writer of this \\nbook would use Sergeants Condition Pills in all cases \\n\\nAs to Prevention \\n\\nCommencing with the egg it has been found that they are formed and \\nundergo changes while in the oviduct of the female After being passed \\nout of the dogs bowels with the stools they undergo further changes in \\nsurface soil the time occupied depending on the suitability of the surround \\nings the essential features being moisture and favorable temperatures \\nWhere conditions are favorable the eggs are hatched out in a few days and \\nafter the embryos have undergone several moultings they are ready to \\ninfect dogs by means of drinking water or contaminated food \\n\\nThe important features to remember are 1 That the eggs are hatch \\ned out not while in the intestine of the dog but after being passed out with \\nthe stools From this it follows then that every individual hookworm \\npresent in the intestines of the dogrepresents infection by a single embryo \\nIn other words the parasites do not actually increase in number while \\nin the dogs intestines 2 Moisture is absolutely essential to the hatch \\ning out of the eggs Drinking troughs and contaminated water supply are \\ntherefore rightly considered as the chief sources of infection \\n\\n\\nFrom these facts it can be seen that the essentials of prevention of \\nhookworm disease are absolute cleanliness in every particular especially as \\nregards feeding pans and water vessels and disinfection of all excretions \\nand soiled bedding When an animal dies the body should be buried in \\nquicklime or better still cremated Above all dampness must be avoided \\nin every possible way \\n\\nFor disinfecting sleeping quarters dry sawdust impregnated with a \\nreliable disinfectant is of great value as it absorbs moisure and when \\nbrushed out carries away and destroys the eggs of the parasite Woodwork \\nmay be whitewashed or painted and all floors should be cleaned out at \\nleast once daily Earth floors should be covered with boards or concrete \\nAs damp soil is the medium in which the embryos develop outdoor runs \\nshould be dressed with quicklime well drained and covered with several \\ninches of furnace ashes or crushed coke This when alternately rolled and \\nsprinkled with crude petroleum will in time form a waterproof asphalt \\nlike surface which will carry off water according to the direction in which \\nit is sloped All food and drinking water should be given in clean pans \\nand under no consideration should dogs be allowed to eat from the floor \\nof sleeping quarters or from the ground in the runs To prevent mud from \\nbeing carried into the kennels on the feet of kennel men or visitors where \\nthe surrounding grounds are liable to be muddy board walks and a door \\nmat and scraper at the kennel entrance should be laid down \\n\\nConfinement to kennel quarters in some districts seems to be the only \\nsafe plan to avoid the disease as when allowed to roam at liberty dogs \\nwill drink from stagnant of surface water and thus become infected \\nSuspected cases should be isolated whenever possible \\n\\nHookworm disease is not necessarily nor commonly fatal to adult \\ndogs in fact in Western Pennsylvania it is the rule rather than the ex \\nception to find a few hookworms in dogs dead from other causes It is \\nsuch cases that constitute a danger to young and susceptible dogs When \\nthe method of reproduction of the hookworm is taken into consideration \\nit can be understood that when reinfection is prevented by following the \\nprecautions suggested it is quite possible for a dog to be entirely freed \\nfrom hookworms provided his vitality be kept up to the highest standard \\nduring the period necessary to get rid of the worms by cautious and per \\nsistent treatment \\n\\nIndigestion Dyspepsia â€” This means that food taken into the stom \\nach is not digested or made fit for the nourishment of the body and that \\nthe stomach has altogether or partially lost its power of performing its \\nmost important office This is caused in various ways want of exercise \\nimproper food or having been fed irregularly Having been overfed or \\nhaving fasted too long will produce indigestion but to cause a serious \\nattack the causes must have been of some standing \\n\\nSymptoms â€” A vitiated appetite wholesome food he will turn his nose \\nup at or eat it mincingly with a preference for filth and garbage Con \\nsiderable thirst it present and often vomiting Flatulence is also an ac \\ncompaniment and the gums become inflamed and breath is foul and offensive \\nwhen of long standing Indigestion causes many other forms of disease \\n\\nfollowing neglected cases â€” attacks of diarrhea sometimes alternating with \\nfits of constipation as derangement of the bowels are almost inseparate \\nfrom it Confirmed constipation sometimes exists The dog may become \\nexcessively fat and suffer from asthma accompanied by a cough The \\ndogs temper is often snappish during the attack \\n\\nIndigestion is the cause of many other forms of disease which are \\nsure to follow neglected cases â€” derangement of the bowels being almost \\ninseparable from it Diarrhea attacks occur often alternating with fits \\nof constipation or confirmed constipation may exist A dog will often \\nbecome excessively fat and suffer from asthma and asthmatic cough \\n\\nA secondary symptom is skin disease in one form or another In treat \\ning for indigestion tho most important thing to do is to remove the cause \\nor causes Give a sufficiency only of plain wholesome food and keep \\nwithin the dogs reach a supply of clean fresh water Remedies must be \\ngiven according to existing circumstances â€” diarrhea for instance treated \\nas recommended under that head The main object is however to tone up \\nthe stomach and get this organ again into good working shape Use the \\nfollowing aperient bolus \\n\\nBarbadoes aloes 15 grains \\n\\nJalap 1 dram \\n\\nTowdered

have used with good results in lieu of the above pill Claytons Di \\ngestive Pills and believe to be very good \\n\\nThe following article I found somewhere and as it is worth repro \\nducing here entire I give it space in this book \\n\\nAs in man and many animals indigestion in the dog may be acute \\nchronic and passive In acute indigestion the attack is sudden and painful \\nand is the result of an overloaded stomach The disorder is called chronic \\nwhen the dog suffers for a continued time and his stomach and intestines \\n\\n\\nare in a weakened condition It is active when the attack is brought on \\nby some extrinsic cause passive when it is the result of some other disease \\nor is due to an intrinsic cause \\n\\nThe breeds of dogs most likely to be affected by indigestion are \\nthe pug the Japanese spaniel the black and tan the greyhound the \\nYorkshire terrier the French poodle and the fox terrier \\n\\nPugs are probably the greatest sufferers As a rule they are en \\ncouraged in laziness while sweetmeats are fed to them indiscriminately \\nso that it is not surprising they should become fat and dyspeptic \\n\\nThe foods which are richest in fats and those which are prone to \\nfermentation are the most indigestible but it is not so much the nature of \\nthe food as it is the quantity consumed at one time which injures an \\nanimals stomach Small dogs are more voracious in their feeding than \\nlarge dogs Some dogs never or seldom get a bone to gnaw The dog is a \\ncarnivorous animal and in a state of nature he lives only on the flesh of \\nother animals As he swallows his food with but little mastication Nature \\nhas provided him with a desire to gnaw the bones into small pieces When \\nthese small pieces are taken into the stomach they bruise and lacerate the \\nfood until it is made thoroughly digestible It is believed that 70 per \\ncent of the cases of indigestion in dogs are due to their being deprived \\nof bones to gnaw Domestication has to a great extent modified the habits \\nof the dog Some pets are pampered and spoiled to the degree that they \\nwill eat only certain foods which must be fed to them with a fork or from \\nsome particular dish Such peculiarities are predisposing causes to indi \\ngestion \\n\\nA symptom of acute indigestion is vomiting after feeding Later \\nthis is followed by general dullness the dog isolates himself from his \\nfriends his eyes roll with an expression of fear The muzzle may be dry \\nRumbling sounds in the bowel sare heard accompanied by distension of \\nthe abdomen which is filled with gas If the animal is forced to move \\nhe shows great uneasiness and is stiff in his posterior limbs his back \\narched to relieve the tension of the abdominal muscles If the abdomen is \\nmanipulated he evinces acute pain The bowels are constipated These \\nsymptoms may continue for an hour or more and the attack may pass off \\nas suddenly as it began or it may last for some length of time during \\nwhich the dog suffers the greatest pain Then the pain ceases his eyes \\nbrighten he becomes cheerful and off he goes for a run apparently per \\nfectly well \\n\\nThe symptoms of chronic indigestion are the same as those of the \\nacute attack only they are less intense and they continue for days at a \\ntime The dog often grows irritable to a state of fenzy and will run about \\nsnapping and biting exposing himself to be shot for mad by some over \\nzealous policeman \\n\\nAs regards treatment it is more important to regulate the diet \\nthan to give medicines Feed the sufferer once or twice a day not oftener \\nand feed him sparingly Give him five 5 grains of saccharated pepsin \\nbefore meals and five 5 grains each of subnitrate of bismuth and bi \\ncarbonate of soda after meals For small dogs such as terriers black \\nand tans Japanese spaniels etc the dose should he reduced onehalf \\n\\nInversion of the Vagina â€” See Uterus Inversion of \\n\\nInfluenza

the latter \\ncomes as a sequel of the acute The causes of this disease in most cases \\nare traceable to improper and overfeeding combined with lack of exercise \\nwhich accounts for the great number of such cases occurring in house and \\npet dogs In hunting dogs it can be brought on by continued exposure to \\nwet or their going into water in cold weather sleeping in damp places \\nof

similar to those infesting man One the Haematopinus \\npiliferus is generally found about the throat and back of the ears but may \\nextend over all parts of the body The female is two mm long in color \\na yellowish white the head being a little darker than the body The male \\nis 115 mm long The head is short and as wide as it is long It is salient \\nand is exactly applied to the thorax The third and fourth articles of the \\nantennae are alike The female is about 2 mm in length The abdomen \\nis a long oval in shape and well developed It is made up of nine round \\nsegments the first seven having two rows of short bristles The other \\nlouse Trichodectes latus is a bright yellow with dark spots with blackish \\nbrown bands on the head The female in length is 15 mm the male 14 \\nmm The head is wider than it is long The antennae are hairy and differ \\n\\nent In both sexes the first article in the male being much thicker than \\nthe other The abdomen is broad and more rounded in the female than in \\nthe male and has lateral but no median spots \\n\\nLice live in all parts of the body â€” the roots of the ears around the eyes \\nand all about the head and face as well as along the top of the back They \\nspt up an irritation that causes the dog to scratch and worry continually \\nand if the skin be closely examined streaks and dots of blood will indicate \\nthe feeding places of these pests which are easily discerned creeping about \\n\\nThe rapidity with which lice multiply is marvelous Independent of \\nthe destructive influences which restrain their multiplying it is estimated \\nthat the descendants in the third generation of one female louse will num \\nber 125000 v \\n\\nThe most effectual and the safest remedy for the destruction of lice \\nis a lime and sulphur lotion The skin should be thoroughly saturated \\nwith it for ten or fifteen minutes and at the end of this time the dog \\nshould be given a bath in lukewarm water a standard dog soap being \\nused He should then be brushed and combed until thoroughly dried \\nCovering the dog with a mixture of cotton seed oil and crude coal oil in \\nequal parts and then washing the dog at the end of a half hour with warm \\nwater and dog soap will kill eithpr fleas or lice \\n\\nEberharts Skin Remedy will kill lice It should be thoroughly rub \\nbed in not missing a spot on the dog After it has been on half an hour \\nthen the dog can be washed and dried this bath only given to remove the \\ngrease if it is a house pet If in warm weather and dog can be kept out \\nin the yard the bath is not necessary The application must be repeated \\nat least once more In twentyfour hours to kill the nits or the young \\nones that are born every twentyfour hours My dog soap will

\\nsmall bellows made for that purpose that is of assistance in spreading it \\nwell around the roots of the hair After allowing it to remain on some \\ntime â€” fifteen minutes to one hour â€” it can be dusted out over a sheet of pa \\nper which can then be rolled up and burned \\n\\nLockJaw Tetanus â€” This is of very rare occurrence a fact all the \\nmore remarkable when we consider how liable the dog is to various spas \\nmodic affections I have never seen a case of it myself but Blaine describes \\nit and it is a recognized canine disease It is a form of tetanus and under \\nthat head Professor J Woodroffe Hill describes the symptoms When the \\njaws only are affected the head is poked out the jaws are tightly closed \\nthe angles of the mouth are drawn back the mouth is filled with frothy \\nsaliva and the eyes are fixed in an unnatural and often hideous position \\n\\nIf you are so unfortunate as to have a dog seized with lockjaw place \\nhim in quiet place on a good bed where the light is subdued and he will \\nnot be liable to be disturbed and send at once for the best veterinary \\n\\n\\nsurgeon you can find A cure is very doubtful even with the most skilled \\ntreatment but as a matter of duty and humanity try and help your dog \\nthrough this most dangerous trouble if it is possible All owners of dogs \\nshould keep informed as to the veterinarians in their town or city as to \\nwhich one is experienced in canine practice so that when a case is urgent \\nyou will know what one to call in and just where to find him Officious \\nignorance and rough

them \\nNow not only is such very unsightly but when grown to a considerable \\nSize as it will do it is very liable to injury \\n\\nThe immediate cause is the damming up of one of the milkducts \\nthe teat is blind as it is called in dairy parlance â€” that is the flow of \\nmilk through it is obstructed by some malformation Far oftener however \\nthe milk itself is the cause that is to say it is not drained off sufficiently \\nwhen it hardens acts as a foreign body and still further as an irritant be \\ncause of its chemical decomposition The effect of this is that more or less \\ninflammation of the milkgland is produced a hard lump forms and increases \\ngradually and once begun the evil develops more and more at each return \\ning period after oestrum when pupping has or should have taken place \\n\\nFrom the numerous questions I have received on the subject it does \\nnot appear to be generally known by those who keep dogs that some bitches \\neven if they have been secluded from the dog during the period of heat \\nwill secrete a fluid much resembling milk at the time they would have had \\npups had impregnation been allowed but such is the case It is therefore \\nthe duty of the owner to note the time and look out for the evidence of \\nthis secretion and have it removed by hand or by one of the many breast \\nexhausters giving at the same time a light diet with an extra proportion of \\nboiled vegetables and a few doses of cooling aperient medicine Permit \\nting a bitch when in milk to lie on cold bricks or flags or to be exposed in \\nother ways to cold and damp may also cause obstruction af the teat and \\nsubsequent tumors while blows bruises and wounds sometimes produce a \\nlike result A not uncommon cause of these lacteal tumors Is the hurried \\ndrying up of the milk by artificial means It is sometimes desirable to \\ndestroy pups that are the result of a mesalliance but it is absolutely cruel \\nto deprive the poor mother of all her progeny In addition to the cruelty \\n\\nthere is always the risk of the flow of milk clamming up one or more of the \\nteats and producing tumor \\n\\nThe measure of prevention against lacteal tumors will from the \\nforegoing remarks have suggested themselves to the reader Nature has \\nordained that the bitch should bring forth young at least once in twelve \\nmonths and though she permits us to take certan liberties with her laws \\nyet if we go beyond a certain limit disease follows as a punishment even \\nwhen we interfere with her prerogative it must not be by direct contradic \\ntion but by diverting her forces into other channels When we forbid the \\nbitch to breed we put an embargo on certain functions and the energy \\nthat supplies and works these functions we divert by exciting extra secre \\ntions of the bowels kidneys etc but the safest because the most natural \\nprevention of disease is to let the bitch breed \\n\\nWhen it is desired to dry the bitch that is to stop the secretion of \\nmilk it is wrong to give alum and other astringents and to rub brandy \\netc along the mammae The object is more surely obtained gradually \\nand that without the risk of untoward results by drawing off what mlk \\nthere is regularly giving a spare diet and a good purge following this \\nwith 2 grains to 3 grains of iodide of potassium twice a day and rubbing \\nwell with the following liniment \\n\\nLniment for Drying Bitches â€” Iodde of potassium 2 drams soap lini \\nment and oil of camphor of each 2 ounces \\n\\nWhen a tumor does form and the bitch is still in milk draw the milk \\noff twice a day and in any case give a brisk purge Keep her on a spare \\nand rather dry diet and to one of 20 lb weight give twice a day 2 grains \\nof iodide

Camphorated Oil is also used in such cases and \\nfor drying up the milk I have found it very satisfactory \\n\\nDent treats this subject as follows \\n\\nNature has ordained that at least once a year certain nervous energies \\nin the female clog be set in motion This nervous force excites the bowels \\nthe brain the kidneys the circulation and all the other organs of the body \\nand what is known as the period of oestrum or being in season is the \\nresult If the bitch be bred at this time a natural function is performed \\nand a natural law satisfied If she is not bred these functions are seriously \\ninterfered with for the time how seriously or the extent of the interference \\nwe do not know That this nervous action does not cease or is entirely \\nsuppressed by simply putting the bitch by for the time is unmistakably \\ndenied by subsequent events A natural prerogative asserts itself and it is \\na common occurrence for bitches which have not been bred to develop \\na feverish disturbance of the system a swelling of the milk glands and the \\nsecretion of a whitish fluid resembling milk at the time they would have \\ngiven birth to puppies if they had been bred \\n\\nIf this milky fluid is not drawn off with the breast pump there is \\ndanger of its hardening and forming a lacteal tumor In passing a bitch \\nover the period of oestrum without breeding her it would be

biscuits softened in soup or milk with an \\nincreased amount of vegetables and keep the bowels open with doses of \\ncascara sagrada and olive oil as often as may be necessary In cases of \\na misalliance the puppies are frequently destroyed at birth This is posi \\ntively cruel to the mother and the shock to her nervous system is so great as \\nto frequently affect her constitution The

it may occur from overexertion \\nthrough running too far or from fractured ribs penetrating the lungtissue \\n\\nThe more notable symptoms are quick and labored breathing the in \\nspirations being full the expirations short and the breath hot The dog \\nsits on his haunches and if obliged to move doeg so reluctantly and soon \\nresumes that position with his head pushed forward The ribs are mora \\nor less fixed and the abdominal muscles brought Into action especially If \\npleurisy is present The fixed position of the ribs with the heaving of the \\nflanks is a most characteristic symptom of pleurisy In affections of the \\nlungs the animal stands with its legs fore legs wide apart If the dis \\nease progresses the face has a haggard expression the angle of the mouth \\nis

troublesome and in some forms the most loathsome dis \\nease met with in the dog occurring in so many forms as to be not always \\neasy of distinction The trouble with too many dog owners is that when \\nany skin trouble appears they are most likely to call it Mange Mange and \\nEczema are too often confounded and as there is a decided difference \\nmange being a skin trouble due to a parasite while eczema is a blood \\ntrouble the two diseases require different treatment The term mange as \\napplied to animals is identical with itch in the human race in both of \\nwhich exist parasite life in the skin and is a cutaneous disease The very \\npronounced distinction between true mange and eczema and other causes \\nof irritation of the skin is that mange is caused by a parasite invisible to \\nthe naked eye and that it is transferable by contact from one animal to \\nanother while eczema blotch surfiet or red mange is not And while a \\nwhole kennel may be suffering from the latter compalints it must be be \\ncause all have been subjected to conditions of life occasioning derange \\nment of the system eczema remains an individual disease and is never \\ntransmitted True mange resembles itch in man as it is due to a small \\nparasite that burrows or tunnels through the skin in all directions draw \\ning its nourishment therefrom The female deposits her eggs In the canals \\nformed which hatch out in about two weeks the young continue bur \\nrowing and occasion intense itching True mange is entirely a local affec \\ntion and the uneasiness and loss of sleep causes the animal to continually \\nscratch and bite itself in Its vain efforts to allay the intolerable pain and \\nitching This has a very debilitating effect upon the system and will soon \\ntransform a healthy and sleek coated pet into a loathsome object \\n\\nThe cause is invariably the result of having met some dog or other \\nanimal that w affected with mange One dog meeting another or occu \\n\\n\\nr 1 \\n\\npying his kennel or sleeping quarters or being shipped in a crate that \\nwas used by a dog with mango will surely contract it Absolute clean \\nliness is necessary in the treatment

troubles The reason why so many people dread this disease is be \\ncause of their failure to cure what they wrongly suppose is mange when \\nit perhaps is eczema which is a much longer story but can also be cured \\nand the treatment of which is given under that heading Remember that \\nif you have more than one dog the others will get it unless the afflicted \\none is removed and isolateu in time The advantage of having a regular \\nkennel or place for each dog to sleep is manifest in treating the dog for \\nmange as thus you can disinfect his kennel and destroy the bedding which \\nare both infected whereas if your dog was sleeping any place he wanted \\nto in your house this would be a very difficult matter and while you cured \\nhim he could again contract it by coming in contact with the parasites that \\nhad not been destroyed \\n\\nYou need not have any fear of con i racting mange from your dog \\nI have treated many cases for years past and never got it â€” not transmit \\nable from the dog to man \\n\\nThere are several skin diseases called by different names or desig \\nnated as different kinds of mange but the treatment I have given for \\nmange and the one for eczema about covers the whole ground of skin \\ntrouble or my remedy will cure them all excepting that in some of them as \\nin eczema internal remedies must also be used at the same time to work \\non the blood Eczema is fully treated elsewhere Carbolic acid is used \\nin many mange cures a dangerous ingredient unless carefully used and \\nin small quantities \\n\\nMy longtime friend Harry Y Lacy editor of American Fancier and \\nStockkeeper has this to say of mange read it also \\n\\nIt is quite true that eczema or red mange is to some extent con \\ntagious but we have not found it to be so to any extent which would justify \\nthe term being applied to it It is desirable always to keep a dog affected \\nwith skin disease away from other dogs because constant contact in the \\nkennel or at play is liable to give rise to an exchange of skin complaint \\nOn the other hand a dog with distemper which is very contagious is made \\nto give it to animals which never come mar to him and a dog with \\nfleas will furnish a supply to ail his fellows in the neighborhood In most \\ncases mange is however not due to contact by the victim with another \\nmangy cur but is due to outandout neglect Mange is never known in \\nkennels where the dogs are properly looked after it is a cultivation of the \\n\\n\\nHObackyard and thrives best upon the poor chainedup brute that is more \\nhuman than his owner who keeps him chained there In a word filth ia \\nthe soil on which alone the sarcoptic parasite can thrive \\n\\nA dog with ordinary skin irritation developing into redness and \\nrash has acquired that in one of two ways Either he has an hereditary \\npredisposition to skin complaint and here let it be said that this heredi \\ntary predisposition is a very common fact and is due undoubtedly in a \\ngreat measure to the inbreeding which has been carried on to a greater or \\nless extent in all breeds or else he is suffering from impurity in the blood \\nwhich may be clue to overfeeding or liver complaint or want of sufficient \\nexercise or any one of a dozen other things If the former be the case it is \\nby no means probable that a cure will be effected and the most important \\nthing that can be done is in the direction of preventing the disease from \\nbeing handed down to other generations If it is intended to breed from \\nthe dog it should be mated with the newest blood possible â€” that is to say \\nwith an animal having a very different pedigree from its own The disease \\nis certain to reappear even after the dog has been apparently cured A \\nhange of diet or of weather will always be liable to precipitate a fresh \\nattack \\n\\nThe following treatise on mange was written by Dalziel and to it your \\nattention is called A very able handling of the subject \\n\\nSarcoptic Mange â€” The mite producing this most nearly resembles the \\nitchmite of man and as it is propagated by eggs and transmitted by \\ncontact direct or indirect there seems nothing impossible in the idea of \\nstamping out this chief enemy to the comfort of a brave spaniel if only \\nwe could get every clog owner to be careful and clean There is much virtue \\nin an if but at least we can learn from the facts about the mangemite \\nthat we need not harbor it in our own kennels and by stamping it out \\nthere lessen it generally Dirt unquestionably harbors and encourages \\nmange although it does not produce it left undisturbed by cleansing pro \\ncesses the pests breed and multiply with great rapidity \\n\\nWhen the mite reaches the dog it burrows into the skin the pro \\ncess and also a poisonous fluid discharged by the creature causes intol \\nerable itching and to relieve this the dog scratches with the result that \\nthe skin is broken small red points appear and these become pustular \\nand discharge a fluid which dries or crusts and forms a scab the hair \\nfalls off The multiplication of the original cause of the evil is rapid and \\nleft unchecked the whole surface of the body soon becomes involved \\nwhile the poor dog is an object of pity and from want of rest and other \\ncauses sinks into a helpless condition This state is often called virulent \\nor scabby mange and presents many of the characteristics of Blotch The \\nskin is harsh dry and rough until small pimples appear when therefrom \\noozes a purulent matter forming scabs which mat the hair together and \\nbring it off in patches as the dog rubs or scratches himself The back \\nbreast and inside of the thighs are generally the first places attacked and \\nevery crease and wrinkle in the skin becomes inflamed and moist with the \\nirritating discharge If the disease is left unchecked it soon extends over \\nthe whole body reducing the dog to a deplorable condition disgusting to \\nall who see him and intolerable to himself These are severe and extreme \\neases In others a dry scurfy mange exists marked by little red spots \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nand confined to the joints of the legs over the eyes the flaps of the ears \\netc and this may exist for some time without other damage than causing \\nthe dog great uneasiness and injury to his appearance by partially destroy \\ning the hair and robbing it of its natural glossy appearance \\n\\nThe first thing to be done with a mangy dog is to wash him Let him \\nhave a good sousing and scrubbing with a good soap and water hottish \\nrather but not so boiling as to turn him red dry well with a soft cloth \\nwhich mast immediately be boiled and then dress him with one or the \\nother of the several well known mange cures Whatever you use see that \\nit is applied thoroughly see that it reaches the skin where the mites are \\nand is not merely left on the hair Chronic cases of mange often take a \\nmonth or two to cure Sulphur is given as an internal remedy for mange \\nbut it is not of any use in mange \\n\\nFollicular Mango is due to another mite Demodex folloculorum very \\ndifferent in appearance from the other Saroptes which are short and \\nthick whereas this the Demodex is elongated and with a long obtuse \\ntail These parasites differ in their habits the Demodex living in the \\nhairfollicles and burrowing deep under the skin in the sebaceous gland \\nthat supplies the unctous matter to protect the skin and keep it soft \\nThe depth to which the Demodex burrows renders Follicular Mange much \\nlets easy of transmission between dogs but it also makes a cure much \\nmore difficult as the parasites are hard to reach This mite is identical \\nwith a parasite found in the human skin causing some disfiguration of \\nthe face but further than that it does no harm until transferred to the \\ndog when it causes a most repulsive disease and one very difficult to \\nâ€radicate \\n\\nSome few yean ago Mr Wm Hunting FRSVS in conjunction with \\nProfesor Duguid made a series of investigations and experiments in eluci \\ndation of this disease and the following description of symptoms and \\nthe diagnosis are from an article by the former gentleman which appeared \\nin the Veterinary Journal and afterward in pamphlet form \\n\\nThe symptoms of the disease are seldom seen in the first stages they \\nconsist merely of circumscribed spots from which the hair fallsy and upon \\nwhich are noticeable a few small pimples These patches extend rapidly and \\nfresh ones appear on other parts Any portion of the skin may be affected \\nbut the head legs belly and sides are usually the seat of the disease \\nThe affected places are almost hairless and what hair remains is easily \\npulled out small pimples and pustules stud the surface the latter varying \\nin size from a pins head to that of a pea The confluence of the pustules \\nand the discharge of their contents give rise to scabs these crack and \\nbleed and so produce a most repulsive appearance In whitehaired dogs \\nIhe skin is red in all it is extremely hot and emits an unpleasant odor \\nThe irritation does not excite much scratching but the dog frequently \\nshakes himself More pain than itshing seems to accompany the disease \\nIn cases where the whole body is affected loss of condition is most marked \\nand in cold weather the almost total loss of hair may cause death if the \\nanimal be not kept in a warm place This stage too is always accom \\npanied by ravenous appetite due probably to the rapid loss of animal \\nheat \\n\\n\\nDiagnosis â€” In white clogs the color of the skin may cause the disease \\nto be mistaken for Red Mange or Eczema The circumscribed spots in \\nthe first stages may be confounded with some forms of Tinea and the loss \\nof hair and the presence of scabs seen in the fully developed disease may \\neasily be mistaken for ordinary scabies The pustules the heat of the skin \\nand the comparatively slight itchiness shown are however nearly diagnos \\ntic Positive diagnosis can only be made by the aid of the microscope and \\nthe detection of the parasite If we puncture one of the pustules and mix \\nits contents on a slide with a little water the acari are easily discovered \\nI have found as many as thirty to one pustule Sometimes we may detect \\nthem on the root of a hair removed from an affected spot With a low \\npower the parasites somewhat resemble sprats or minnows but a higher \\npower shows them to consist of a head and body which latter terminates \\nin a long and obtusely pointed tail They are furnished with six or eight \\nlegs situated on the anterior part of the body three or four on each side \\nThe head consists of two antennse and a median proboscis all of which \\nare capable of being moved forward or backward The legs consist of \\nthree segments The movements of the creatures are not often seen and \\nare very slow The parasite measures about onehundredth of an inch in \\nlength by one fivehundredth in breadth \\n\\nIn regard to treatment Fleming in Veterinary Sanitary Science says \\nThe situation of the Demodex renders it almost inaccessible to parasi \\ntical remedies the disease it engenders is therefore looked upon as ex \\ntremely troublesome and in the majority of cases almost beyond a cure \\nOften when it is believed to be extinguished it reappears in all its viru \\nlence in one or two months Nevertheless Zurn asserts that he has fre \\nquently succeeded with an ointment composed of 1 part of benzine to 4 \\nparts of lard Zundel states that the balsam of Peru has often yielded \\ngood results when the malady has not been of too long duration he has \\nemployed it dissolved in alcohol 1 to 30 \\n\\nSymptoms of Scaroptic Mange â€” In pronounced cases this disease is \\neasily recognizable but in the initial stages when the hair is not much \\nlost or broken if complicated with eczema â€” which is not uncommon â€” \\ndiagnosis is more difficult \\n\\nThe first symptom is that of great irritation of the affected parts \\nespecially on the application of heat \\n\\nThe symptoms first appear in the form of small red spots which may \\nbe seen on the head close to the muzzle the outside of the roots of the \\nears round the eyes and neck the bottom part of the chest the elbows \\nthe soft skin of the stomach behind the thighs and the feet \\n\\nAs a matter of fact it may appear on any part of the body The \\nsmall red spots resemble flea bites on the human skin These red spots \\nare more noticeable when situated on the stomach or inside the thighs \\n\\nLittle blisters appear in place of the red spots and if they are in \\nlarge numbers and burst open sores appear \\n\\nInjury will result from an inoculation of the skin with the contents \\nof the blisters which often occurs as a result of scratching or rubbing \\n\\nDoss of hair will follow this and is caused partly by the scratching \\nand partly by the scaling of the crusts of the skin caused by the small \\nblisters and pimples 113 \\n\\nTe skin then becomes thickened and hardened In neglected cases the \\ngeneral health is very much affected as the animal gets little rest and \\nin weakly subjects generally results fatally \\n\\nScaroptic Mange is very readily communicated to the human subject \\nand is the cause in most cases of what is termed Scabbies and is far more \\ncommon than is generally supposed But Scaroptic Mange is comparatively \\neasy to cure if taken in hand rightly It is a waste of time to simply \\napply a mange cure to the affected parts To complete a cure you must \\ntreat your dog internally as well as externally or you will never have a \\nperfect cure \\n\\nHere is where I should try Eberharts Skin Remedy â€” and for the \\nblood use internally the White Sulphur as advised for Eczema See \\nEczema \\n\\nMouth Canker of the â€” This is generally the result of dainty feeding \\nand lack of exercise but in old dogs it may come from failing teeth and want \\nof masticating power Either or both of these causes lead to disordered \\nstomach and foul breath a deposit of tartar takes place the gums and \\nlips becoming red inflamed and spongy and after a time a fetid discharge \\nfrom the mouth and often accompanied with bleeding Old animals are \\nmost subject to this trouble and by examining you will probably find some \\ndecayed teeth the gums being so tender that in attempting to eat the \\ndog suffers great pain which he will show by his trying to chew the food \\nfor a minute roll it about in his mouth and then drop it \\n\\nTo cure the disease remove the cause If you have been cramming the \\ndog with delicacies return to a sensible way of feeding and give proper \\nexercise Examine his mouth carefully for decayed teeth and if found \\nremove them and the rotten stumps with a pair of suitable forceps This \\nis not so difficult and you can do it by having some one hold the dogs \\nhead firmly and can be done more easily than may be supposed a very \\nlittle practice making any one efficient While his mouth is in such a \\ntender state he must have food that requires no chewing as well as to \\nkeep correct his disordered stomach A vegetable diet is now the thing \\nGive him quite a brisk dose of the following pills \\n\\nPodophyllin 6 grains \\n\\nCompound extract of colocynth 30 grains \\n\\nPowdered rhubarb 48 grains \\n\\nExtract of henbane 36 grains \\n\\nMix and divide into twentyfour pills Give for grown

enlargement of the navel often met \\nwith in puppies and may be simply an expansion of the same or cicatrice \\nNavel hernia is the protrusion of a portion of the intestine â€” the membra \\nneous covering of the bowels It may be caused by extra strain at birth \\non the umbilical cord or the tongue of the mother may extend the wound \\nIt is a soft movable tumor over the navel varying in size and most prom \\ninent when the stomach and bowels are full I have seen it occur in pup \\npies but so slight that I did not do anything for them it doing no harm \\nand only leaving a small lump that was never noticed as they grew up \\nthe hair on the belly hiding it In treating puppies for it wait till they are \\nweaned and separated from their mother or she will with her tongue \\nremove or displace the application Now take the puppy in the morn \\ning before his breakfast when bowels are empty lay him on his back on \\nyour lap and place over the enlargement a pad of vulcanized India rubber or \\ncork tapered the smaller end being applied on the tumor after it has been \\npressed in and the pad secured by strips of white leather smeared with \\nwarm pitch plaster well stuck to the belly so pup can not scratch it off with \\nits feet A cure can be effected in a few weeks if the pad is kept in place \\n\\nHere is a case that was prescribed for by Dent \\n\\nMy pointer puppy ten weeks old strong and healthy has a rupture \\nright under its belly near the ribs and about the size of a very large pea \\n\\n\\n116Will it have any bad effect on the dog after being cured Please prescribe \\nAns â€” These navel ruptures frequently disappear with age and seldom \\ncause any inconvenience If you want to operate on the rupture lay the \\ndog on his back pinch the skin up over the opening in the walls of the \\nabdomen and pass two pins through at right angles to each other being \\ncareful not to puncture the intestines then tie a silk cord around the skin \\nbetween the

is generally due to violence \\n\\nblows or to constitutional disturbance like rheumatism or scrofula Symp \\ntoms are pain heat and swelling of the skin at the affected part also lame \\nness Very essential in such cases is rest combined with hot fomenta \\ntions to the part and a dose of aperient medicine when due to rheumatism \\nthe systemic treatment recommended under Rheumatism should be adopt \\ned and should there be an enlargement left after the acute inflammation \\nhas subsided the part should be painted daily with tincture of iodine unless \\nsoreness is produced when this treatment should cease for a day or two \\n\\nOzoena â€” This complaint shows itself by a discharge from both nos \\ntrils The causes are diseased teeth protracted catarrh causing chronic \\ninflammation of the lining membrane of the nose polypi or inflammation \\nof the sinuses of the nose due to the presence of foreign matter in that \\norgan Where the disease is due to decayed teeth the latter should be \\nextracted or to polypi these should be removed The nostrils should be \\nsyringed night and morning with a saturated solution of boracic acid or \\nthe tincture of hydrastis is often useful â€” 1 part of tincture to equal parts \\nof water Exercise and fresh air are very necessary to recovery \\n\\nPoisoning â€” A dastardly act is to poison a dog and no punishment is \\ntoo severe to inflict on the cowardly cur who does it If I could have my \\nway about it the cur that poisons a dog would hang by the neck till he \\nwas dead a proper punishment properly fitting the crime If you are so \\nunfortunate as to have your dog poisoned keep your eye open on your \\nneighbors â€” who perhaps are unfortunately such degenerates that they \\ndo not like dogs Bide your time but never give up trying to land the \\ncur who poisoned your dog and then if you can not have positive proof \\nenough to punish him or her legally try some other plan quietly and \\nnever give up until you have in some way punished the one who killed \\nyour dog \\n\\nI am devoting considerable space to this subjett as it is important \\nand advise that you study this article well so that if you are so unfortunate \\nas to ever have a dog poisoned you may know what to do promptly and \\nperhaps save your dog \\n\\nIt may be of service to some readers io briefly refer to a few of the \\n\\ncommoner and more popularly known poisons from which are dogs are \\nmost likely to suffer and I think the following will cover the majority \\nof cases Arsenic cantharides carbolic acid corrosive sublimate phosphor \\nous and strychnine \\n\\nAs a general rule for distinguishing between the evidence of poisoning \\nand the symptoms of disease the suddenness of the attack must weigh \\nlargely while by tracing where the dog has been and what he has or is \\nlikely to have picked up a pretty accurate conclusion may be arrived at \\n\\nThe first step to be taken in most cases is to freely empty the stomach \\nby means of emetics such as tartar emetic sulphate of zinc ipecacuanha \\nwine one of the most useful and least dangerous to use The dose is from \\n3 drams to 8 drams in a little warm water If none of these are at hand \\nby drenching with lukewarm water and afterwards giving the antidotes \\nindicated if procurable \\n\\nIf the dog suffer much pain a dose of opium or laudanum every three \\nor four hours Where gieat depression and weakness follow stimulants \\nas ether wine or brandy should be given in small quantities at frequent \\nintervals \\n\\nArsenic is used to poison rats mice and other vermin in this way it is \\nfrequently met with in and about country houses \\n\\nSymptoms Great heat and evident pain in the stomach and bowels \\nsometimes accompanied with swelling â€” the belly being very tender to the \\ntouch â€” great thirst frequent vomiting and retching more or less discharge \\nof a frothy saliva and frequent evacuations of fluid dark colored matter \\noften marked with blood The animal soon loses muscular power to a great \\nextent showing an indisposition to move the tongue lips etc are red and \\nswollen and the breathing is more and more labored and painful \\n\\nAntidotes Ferrugo or hydrated sesquioxide of iron 12 parts of which \\ncombine with 1 part of arsenic froming an insoluble compound also light \\nmagnesia which will remove l25th its weight of arsenic from its solution \\nin water \\n\\nCantharides Spanish Fly â€” This is given by ignorant men for pur \\nposes which are defeated but being an acrid irritant poison it produces \\nserious results frequently causing inflammation of the urinary organs \\n\\nSymptoms Violent thirst copious discharge of bloody mucous from \\nthe stomach mixed with which may be seen the shiny green particles of \\nthe flies there are great pains in the loins and bowels swelling and \\ninflammation of the genital organs and bloody stools and urine \\n\\nAntidotes An emetic should at once be resorted to the dog should \\nafterwards be drenched with demulcents and a dose of opium given every \\nthree or four hours \\n\\nCarbolic Acid â€” This produces baneful effects even by absorption \\nthrough the pores of the skin when too freely used It causes great pros \\ntration with trembling of the whole frame \\n\\nSymptoms Extraordinary depression of the vital powers general \\nshivering and almost constant trembling of the limbs and a palsied motion \\nof the head Bleeding at the nose is a frequent symptom and the dis \\n\\n\\ncharges from the bowels are also often stained with blood the counte \\nnance of the sufferer is expressive of a most helpless and painful state \\n\\nAntidoes The proper treatment consists in placing the dog in a warm \\nbath using friction the while and administering such stimulants as am \\nmonia ether brandy etc in water or gruel \\n\\nCorrosive Sublimate is used for a variety of purposes about farms al \\nthough for most of these it must be admitted a nonpoisonous article would \\nanswer as well or better Corrosive sublimate phosphorous and strych \\nnine each enters into the composition of paste and powders largely sold for \\nthe destruction of vermin and it is when so used being placed on bread \\nand butter bits of meat etc that they are most likely to be picked up by \\nthe dog \\n\\nSymptoms Violent vomiting and purging of stringy and offensive \\nmatter the belly is distended and painful to the touch the urine suppress \\ned cramp and twitches are noticeable in the limbs and frequently paraly \\nsis ensues \\n\\nAntidotes Tartar emetic as an emetic white of egg followed imme \\ndiately by infusion of galls milk or gluten of wheat Of the chemical anti \\ndotes the albumen of eggs is by far the best the white of one egg is \\nsufficient to neutralize or render insoluble 4 gr of solid bichloride of mer \\ncury \\n\\nPhosphorous â€” Antidoes Calcined magnesia with diluents and de \\nmulcents given in quantity \\n\\nStrichnine â€” Symptoms Acute pain causing the dog to utter sharp \\ncries frequent twitchings and jerkings of the head and limbs the fore and \\nhind legs are drawn towards each other the back is arched the fits of \\ncramp and twitching are intermittent but are readily brought on by a \\ntouch or a sudden noise Foaming at the mouth is another and frequent \\nsymptom \\n\\nAntidotes Give an emetic at once mustard and hot water coffee salt \\nand hot water give lard or any fat in considerable quantities \\n\\nThe following has saved many valuable dogs poisoned by strychnine \\nand will save any dog if breath is Left in body As soon as the owner is \\nconvinced that the dog has strychnine or dog button nux vomica symp \\ntoms of which are readily detected by spasms and rigid spine give fifteen \\ndrops of homeopathy tincture of belladonia green root Give same dose \\nafter each spasm If dog is too far gone to swallow inject thirty drops in \\nrectum The second dose can be given by mouth It is seldom the third \\ndose is necessary This I copied from letter sent to the American Field \\nby some sportsman who had been out hunting with his pointer He fur \\nther wrote When I reached him he had had some twelve spasms and was \\nrigid tongue cold eyes turned etc Three doses brought the dog out and \\nsome thirty quail were killed over him the next day \\n\\nHere are also other antidotes that are used in cases of poisoning \\n\\nStrychnine is most commonly used to poison dogs and if noticed when \\ntaken sick or even after violent convulsions have set in they can almost \\n\\n\\ndiseases 119 \\n\\nInvariably be saved by injecting under the skin with hypodermic syringe \\nLO grain doses of chloral dissolved in water every 15 or 20 minutes until \\n50 or 60 grains are used \\n\\nIf convulsions quiet down and dog seems better it might be safe to stop \\nwhen 30 or 40 grains have been given \\n\\nIt will pay any one owning a number of dogs to keep a hypodermic \\nsyringe \\n\\nDent says The best antidote for strychnine poisoning is chloral hy \\ndrate size of dose depends upon the condition of the dog in health the \\ndone is 5 to 20 grains \\n\\nDog poisoning is so prevalent in many parts of the country just now \\nit may not be out of place to reproduce part of Mr A J Sewells the \\nnoted English veterinarian article on this subject in the Kennel Gazette \\nEng so that dog owners may be prepared for such emergencies \\n\\nIn all cases of poisoning more especially when due to strychnia \\nprompt action is required and means should be at once taken to make the \\ndog disgorge what has been swallowed An emetic that will act well and \\nquickly must be at once administered for this there is nothing better than \\na dose of apomorphia This medicine acts in two ways it is the quickest \\nand surest emetic and besides it relieves the spasms The dose is the \\neighth of a grain for small dogs and about the quarter of a grain for \\nthe large ones given in a teaspoonful of water but the best way of admin \\nistering it is by injecting it under the skin with a hypodermic syringe â€” \\nthan from three to eight minims of the one in fifty solutions is to be given \\n\\nI always advise persons who keep a number of valuable dogs to have \\na solution of apomorphia by them ready for emergency for while it is being \\nobtained the patient may die and if huntsmen would always carry a small \\nbottle of solution with them many a valuable hounds life might be saved \\nWhen this medicine is not at hand some other emetic must be given Ordi \\nnary table salt can be always quickly procured and from one teaspoonful to \\na tablespoonful according to the size of the dog should be given in warm \\nwater If the dose does not act freely repeat it in a few minutes or instead \\ngive from five to twenty grains of powdered ipecacuanha or from one to \\nthree grains of tar emetic Either of these may be shaken dry on the \\ntongue the dog must be made to vomit somehow but anything like salt \\nrequiring a quantity of water is often difficult to administer as the dogs \\nmouth is often tightly clenched and trying to open it induces a paroxysm \\nduring which time it is impossible to give anything by the mouth and here \\nthe advantage of the subcutaneous injection of apomorphia comes in This \\nmay also be repeated in a quarter of an hour if the vomiting has not been \\nfree Besides the emetic some medicine is necessary to relieve the spasm \\nFro this there is nothing better than chloral and bromide of potassium \\nFrom fifteen grains to two scruples of each may be given in from one to \\nthree tablespoonfuls of water if the dog can be made to swallow and half \\nthe quantity of each may be given again in twenty or thirty minutes and \\nrepeated if necessary in half an hour When the dog is unable to swal \\nlow from three to ten minims of nitrite of amyl held to the nose on a \\npocket handkerchief is useful This may be repeated In a quarter of an \\nhour or chloroform may be given Also inject into the rectum from one \\nhalf to two drams of laudanum in from on to four tablespoonfuls of water \\n\\n\\nwhich repeat in a quarter of an hour and again in another fifteen ininuteS \\nif the paroxysms continue After the severe symptoms have passed and \\nthe dog is weak and prostrate from onehalf to two teaspoonfuls of brandy \\nadded to some milk may be administered and repeated every hour for a \\n\\ntime \\n\\nGround Glass â€” The symptoms are bloody passages great pain and \\ndistress and vomiting of blood There is no cure for this and it is merciful \\nto destroy the poor animal at once ending his suffering by chloroforming \\n\\nI now conclude this article by giving one that was published in the \\nAmerican StockKeeper \\n\\nPhosphorous is a dangerous poison and will be got from ratpaste \\nwhich is left lying about spread on bread and butter For this give an \\nemetic followed by a draught of Magnesia and water Afterwards milk \\nand other demulcents with a few drops of laudanum to allay pain Mer \\ncury may be taken in several forms â€” either as Calomel White Precipi \\ntate or Corrosive Sublimate â€” all of which are accessible to dogs at var \\nious times Give large draughts of white of egg beaten up with water an \\nemetic first Then diet on milk and broth If violent purging give a little \\nlaudanum Sulphate of copper is in common use about farms and so is \\ndangerous to dogs who may pick up and devour dead birds in a corn field \\nin which the seed has been dressed with this poison Its antidotes are \\ndemulcents after the usual emetic such as white of egg and milk and a \\nlittle laudanum later It will be seen from the forecoming that the treat \\nment for all mineral poisons is very similar all round \\n\\nNow as to vegetable poisons or to be more precise organic poisons \\nminerals being inorganic The chief of these as far as they affect dogs \\nand their owners are Aconite Belladonna Digitalis Foxglove Opium \\nStrychnine and their various compounds or derivatives First then \\nAconite which is often given as a medicine and of which it is easy \\nto give an overdose Give an emetic and then proceed with stimulants â€” \\nbrandy etc Keep warm and try artificial respiration if need be For Bel \\nladonna similar treatment Good hot drinks of stimulants Foxglove \\nDigitalis â€” often prescribed for heart affections in dogs as well as in men \\n â€” for this after an emetic give warm tea followed by stimulants Opium \\nthe active principle of which is morphia needs a good emetic followed by \\na draught of brandy and water every effort must be made to subdue drow \\nsiness by brisk exercise until the effect has worn off Lastly Strychnine â€” \\ndeadliest of poisons â€” a component of all vermin killers â€” easily recognized \\nby its effect on the muscles Give an emetic followed by doses of Potas \\nsium Bromide every twenty minutes and later a dose of Castor Oil Strych \\nnine is as we have stated earlier the most active principle of Nux Vomica \\n\\nHere is also some good advice on strychnine poisoning that I found \\nsome place and worth including \\n\\nStrychnine poisoning unfortunately is so rapidly fatal that the dog \\nis usually found dead or dying If there has been immediate vomiting or \\nonly a small dose swallowed the chances of recovery are good when the \\nproper means are available If vomiting has not occurred produce it by \\ngiving a warm solution of common salt a tablespoonful to the pint in large \\n\\ndoses until the stomach is well emptied After this the most important \\nobject is to produce stupor and morphine hypodermically administered as \\nwell as being a good emetic is a safe narcotic in the dog In dogs over \\nsix months old onefourth grain can be given safely for every ten pounds of \\nlive weight This should be followed by chloroform inhalation adminis \\ntered lightly and kept up until the convulsions become less pronounced \\nChloral hydrate is probably the best antidote in cases where it cannot be \\ngiven by the mouth owing to spasm of the cheek muscles It should be \\ngiven in from ten to thirty grain doses dissolved in an ounce of warm \\nwater injected gently in the rectum The dose can be repeated if con \\nsidered necessary every hour The animal suould be kept as quiet as pos \\nsible harsh sounds bright lights or unnecessary handling tending to increase \\nthe severity of the convulsions \\n\\nParasites External â€” The number and variety of parasites that make \\none part or another of the dog their habitat is very great These are di \\nvided into external and internal in the former two distinct mites produc \\ning two very distinct forms of the mange have already been referred to \\nand the internal parasites are treated under Worms \\n\\nThere is no dog owner of much experience who is not aware that great \\ncare and cleanliness are needed to prevent the introduction of these un \\nwelcome visitors or who has not had to pay smartly for their extermina \\ntion if his kennels have been neglected The parasites to which I par \\nticularly wish to direct attention are three in number â€” the louse the flea \\nand the tick â€” which now follow in order named as to treating \\n\\nDog Louse â€” These resemble that of a man only larger in size and can \\nnot live on a human being It causes great irritation the dog scratching \\nand worrying himself constantly They live on all or any part of the \\nbody but most abundant about the head and face the eyes roots of ears \\nand along the top of the back By closely examining the dogs skin red \\nstreaks and dots of blood will be seen where the louse has been feeding \\n\\nOne species is described in Prof Neumanns Parasites translated \\nby Prof Fleming \\n\\nThe head is short and almost as wide as long it is salient in the \\nthorax to which it is exactly applied the third and fourth articles of the \\nantennae are alike The abdomen is very developed in the female and is \\na long oval in shape it has nine rounded segments which are often salient \\nat the sides stigmates distinct and marginal the first seven segments \\nhave two rows of short bristles The general tint is yellowishwhite the \\nhead and thorax being a little darker The female is 2mm long and the \\nmale l15mm This louse is oftener found about the throat and back of \\nthe ears but extends to all parts of the body \\n\\nThe other louse of the dog is Trichodectes latus of which this is \\nNeumanns description The head is subquadrangular and much wider \\nthan it is long being truncated in front the antennas are hairy and dif \\nferent in the two sexes the first article in the male being much thicker \\nand occupying a moiety of the length of the organ The abdomen is broad \\nand more rounded in the female with lateral but no median spots The \\n\\n\\n122 1ISEASES \\n\\ncolor is bright yellow spots darker the bands on the head are blackish \\nbrown Length of the female is l5mm of the male 14mm \\n\\nMy dog soap will destroy lice if thoroughly and well rubbed in allowed \\nto remain on dog for half an hour when you can rinse off and dry the \\ndog If in winter cold or damp weather you must of course be careful \\nand not expose dog to danger of catching cold It is the only preparation \\nin the way of a dog soap that will kill lice containing one ingredient which \\nis a secret that enables it to do such good work in exterminating the pests \\nthat dogs are liable to have and yet perfectly harmless to the dog even \\nif he should lick it being nonpoisonous as well as being excellent for \\nthe coat and a great hair grower I may here add that it is just as good \\nin every way for use on the owners head as it is for his dog In using \\nmy soap to rid a dog of lice give dog a most thorough shampooing with \\nyour hands not missing a spot on his body from tip of nose to end of \\ntail Rub as close up to and around the eye as you can without getting \\nit into the eye but no particular harm could come if the lather get in the \\neye Repeat this application the same way twentyfour hours later this \\nto kill the youngsters that breed every twentyfour hours \\n\\nAfter the application has been on dog for an hour you can then \\nrinse in lukewarm water and dry thoroughly with a rough towel The \\nsame care as to dog being exposed to cold air or draughts must be exer \\ncised as in an ordinary bath My soap can well be termed a wonderful \\ndiscovery and it is without doubt by far the best dog soap ever made \\n\\nHere is another treatment to givo \\n\\nLice the presence of which gives rise to the affection sometimes \\ntermed phthiriasis are of common distribution as parasites throughout \\nthe animal kingdom Two varieties affect the dog namely the Hcemato \\npinus Piliferus and the Trichodectes Latus The first of these as a rule \\nIs chiefly found about the head ears etc but may wander over any part \\nof the body the second is found over various other parts of the body \\nand appears to play an important part in the life history of the tapeworm \\nthe eggs of which it may eat and so act as an intermediary bearer of \\nthe internal parasite which finds its way into the alimentary canal through \\nthe accidental swallowing by the dog of the external parasite \\n\\nBoth species of parasite are destitute of wings yellowish grey or \\nyellow in color and have their mouths specially adapted for sucking \\nPediculi always cause more or less itching consequently a tendency to \\nâ cratch This is not all but in many cases they lead to the formation of \\nscabs \\n\\nThe female is larger than the male and deposits her eggs or nits \\nupon the hairs attaching each one thereto by a tough transparent sheath \\nThe female lays about 50 eggs wEtich are hatched in two days \\n\\nTreatment â€” It is not usually a very difficult matter to get rid of lice \\nThorough cleanliness is essential with disinfection and destruction of all \\nmaterial with which the animal has been in contact Sucking pups are \\nfrequently affected in which case the treatment must be directed to both \\nparent and offspring After cleansing of the kennel destruction of the \\nbedding material etc the former should be washed with soft soap and \\nwarm watr afterwards dressed with the following solution Stavesacre \\nseads 1 ounce water 1 quart The seed must be boiled for about an hour \\n\\nin Water and then adding sufficienl water to bring if up to a quart again \\nWith this the dog should be thoroughly dressed from head to tail taking \\ncare not to leave one hair untouched It is certain death to both parasite \\nand eggs After 24 hours it may be washed off and if necessary applied \\nagain The suckling pups must be combed before being given back to their \\nmother This must be repeated daily until they are perfectly free from \\nvermin They may also be dressed with the same solution but it should \\nbe diluted five ounces of camphor being added to five ounces of camphor \\nwater Of course washing is here inadmissable Another remedy which \\nis equally effectual is a weak solution of lime and sulphur lotion whilst \\nfor animals of a more mature age it may be used of the ordinary strength \\n\\nThe following will also destroy lice \\n\\nFlour of sulphur 1 pound \\n\\nUnslacked lime y2 pound \\n\\nWater 1 gallon \\n\\nSlake the lime in the water stir in the sulphur adding water gradually \\nuntil it is of a creamy consistence then add the remainder of the gallon \\nand boil down to half a gallon let it stand till cool pour off the clear \\nliquid and make the quantity to two and a half quarts with cold water \\nIf the coat and skin is thoroughly saturated with this and left on for ten \\nminutes the vermin will all be dead when the dog should then be well \\nwashed using warm water and thoroughly combed and dried This may \\nbe too strong a solution for delicate toy dogs with tender skins and can \\nbe reduced in strength by adding equal parts of water to one of the lotion \\nIf any doubt exists as to this first try the weaker solution \\n\\nAnother and a harmless and nonpoisonous remedy for lice is Eber \\nharts Skin Cure which will do the work if wrell rubbed in never missing \\na spot on the dog allowed to remain in for half an hour and applied again \\ntwentyfour hours later \\n\\nThese dressings should be repeated in eight days in order to destroy \\nthe young lice from the nits or eggs laid before the previous dressing \\n\\nHere I give also a very good article on Lice which I found some \\nwhere and it is worth including \\n\\nLice cause great irritation and will eventually if means are not taken \\nto rid the dog of the living burden take the blood out of the dog and even \\ntually cause death Of course that is extreme but a bunch of such para \\nsites if not heroically handled will soon get ahead of the operator and \\nthen there is nothing to do but shave the animal and give it a strong \\nsoaking in some mixture that will kill the nits Mercurial ointment is \\na sure knocker but it is not advisable for the novice to use unless in \\nstructed in its application and the precaution to be taken that the dog \\ndoes not lick the ointment afterwards and thus become more or less \\npoisoned This is obviated by muzzling until the ointment wears off or \\nis washed off \\n\\nThe best thing we have found is an emulsion made of onethird very \\nhot milk mixed with twothirds kerosene oil We generally mix it in a \\nkandy bottle with a shake stopper and opening the coat drop in the emul \\n\\n\\nsion which of course must be well shaken while being applied The milk \\ncounteracts any blistering of the skin that might arise from the application \\nof the oil alone This kills everything living and saturates the eggs which \\nare the source of course of future trouble and the reason some people \\nfind it impossible to get rid of lice while the dog lives This treatment \\nis not only death to lice but life to the coat bringing it out in glossy \\nprofusion The milk must be very hot but not boiling or it will curdle \\nin the oil When the emulsion has dried in it is well to wash the dog \\nthough this is not absolutely necessary unless the odor of kerosene is \\noffensive \\n\\nHowever many cures one may make the best one is prevention and \\nthe measures to be adopted will occur to any intelligent dog owner At the \\nsame time if it is a case of the home dog as above it is very difficult to \\nhandle and unless periodic treatment is given the dog the trouble will get \\nahead before you are aware In the kennels one may adopt heroic \\nmeasures in the way of burning partitions and the like nests but in a \\nkitchen however clean it may be kept there are little nooks and cracks \\nthat cannot be so strenuously treated for the dog may lie around in many \\nplaces Applications of strong disinfectants like Standard Disinfectant is \\nvery good for this purpose â€” See their ad in this book \\n\\nNaturally dogs that are kept in clean auarQrs and groomed every \\nday do not have lice unless as we hinted above they touch some dog that \\nhas lice or come in contact with some place where lice dogs frequent This \\nmay seem superfluous advice to the wise owner of dogs but it is just this \\nignorance on the part of novice owners of dogs that breeds lice and kin \\ndred parasites that start skin troubles and all sorts of derangements sauced \\nby continual scratching and the nervous condition in which a dog infested \\nwith lice soon finds itself The emulsion spoken of above may be used \\nwith safety on any dog Should a pet dog start any such trouble rubbing \\nwith alcohol will usually put a quietus on the vermin \\n\\nThe writer has just tried for the first time Standard Disinfectant \\non an Irish setter that came back from a show with lice he got there and \\nin two thorough applications using a stiff brush to apply it I cleared \\nthis dog of the lice I put three ounces Standard Disinfectant in a pail \\nthen added a gallon of water to it and then used a sponge for his head â€” â \\nthen use a stiff brush for rest of his body legs and tail applying it liberally \\nIn ten minutes after I thoroughly dried him with rough towels Only two \\napplications were necessary in his case as I did not miss a spot on him \\nbut sometimes it might be necessary for more applications if you had \\nmissed a few lice \\n\\nA special article from Field and Fancy \\n\\nPleurisy â€” Covering the lungs and reflected over the walls of the chest \\nis a very fine smooth delicate glistening membrane known as the pleura \\nThis membrane is moistened by a fluid that in connection with the smooth \\npolished surface of the membrane permits of the easy frictionless move \\nments of the lungs during breathing Sometimes as a result of wounds \\nbruises or injuries more commonly as the result of colds and occasionally \\nfor no appreciable cause this membrane becomes inflamed and we have a \\n\\n\\nâ€” â \\n\\nmost painful disease known as pleurisy In this disease the lubricating \\nfluid previously mentioned disappears The glistening surface of the mem \\nbrane becomes swollen and roughened so that in breathing the part of the \\nmembrane covering the lungs and the part reflected over the walls of the \\nchest rub together and make breathing a most painful process This stage \\nlasts about twentyfour hours and then the lubricating fluid that disappears \\nat the first sign of the disease begins to reappear in increased quantities \\nand there is a general effusion into the chest cavity on the affected side \\nIn some cases this effusion is so great as to almost or completely fill the \\nspace formerly occupied by the lungs and they are compressed into a small \\nmass and rendered entirely useless In acute attacks of this disease that \\nterminate in recovery there is in a few days a reabsorption of this fluid \\nand the pleura regains its normal condition If the reabsorption of the \\nfluid in the cavity is slow or delayed and extends over a period of two or \\nthree weeks the patient is left with what is known as chronic pleurisy \\n\\nSymptoms In some cases there is a soreness of the chest for two \\nor three days to which no attention has been paid in other cases there is \\na severe chill accompanied by shivering and intense pain in breathing so \\nthat the animal does not completely fill the lungs but takes short quick \\ncatchy breaths There is a cough and all the symptoms of fever such as \\nrestlessness increased thirst loss of appetite watery eyes anxious wor \\nried expression hot dry nose and coated tongue The veins of the eyeball \\nand lips darken in color The animal lies on the affected side so as to allow \\nthe opposite lung more opportunity to expand \\n\\nAn examination of the chest will show a restrained movement of the \\nlungs The characteristic sounds in the first stage are a dry grating rasp \\ning sound caused by the inflamed and roughened surfaces of the pleurae \\nrubbing against each other After effusion of the liquid has taken place \\nwe have the second stage of the disease This is easily determined by per \\ncussion Press two or three fingers of one hand flat and firmly against \\nthe chest wall and strike them with one or two fingers of the other hand \\nThe blows should be quick short and light Strike only once on each \\nspot and move the hand quickly from one spot to another until the entire \\nchest has been covered If this be done to both the well and affected side \\na rapid comparison can be made of the difference in sound If the sound \\ngiven forth is dead flat and woodeny it denotes an absence of air in that \\npart of the chest and indicates that the chest cavity is filled with fluid \\nand the lung compressed into a solid mass On auscultation the respiratory \\nsound is entirely suppressed or only faintly heard An examination of the \\nchest of normal dogs both by auscultation and percussion will familiarize \\nthe owner with the natural sounds so that he will have no difficulty in \\nrecognizing the departures and variations in disease \\n\\nThe pulse in pleurisy is quite diagnostic of the disease being quick \\nhard wiry and much faster than normal The temperature varies from \\n101 to 103 \\n\\nPrognosis Pleurisy although a painful disease is simple as com \\npared to pneumonia or bronchitis As a rule only one side is affected and \\nin the absence of pus the disease generally terminates favorably \\n\\nTreatment In diseases of the chest as in all other diseases diet and \\nhygienic surroundings are of the utmost importance The object in the \\n\\n\\nfirst state is to relieve the pain and suffering and if possible to check the \\nprogress of the disease This is best accomplished by giving a dose of \\nDovers powder varying in size from five to thirty grains depending upon \\nthe size of the dog This will relieve the pain quiet the patient and thus \\nlimit the constitutional disturbance The chest jacket described in the \\ntreatment of pneumonia should then be applied as it is a great protec \\ntion \\n\\nIf a dose or two of Dovers powder early in the disease does not check \\nits course the following prescription may be used \\n\\nMorphine Sulphates â two grains \\n\\nTr Aconite Rad twenty drops \\n\\nAquae three oz \\n\\nFt Mist Sig \\n\\nDose is one teaspoonful every four hours until the animal is quiet \\nand inclined to sleep \\n\\nIf the fluid within the chest cavity docs not disappear within a week \\nthere is danger of its becoming purulent A veterinary surgeon or physi \\ncian should be called in to tap the chest low

\\n\\nKeep up the animals strength by feeding raw lean beef chopped fine \\nraw eggs milk punch mutton broths and anything he will eat of a nour \\nishing nature After the fever abates and the crisis

one set of muscles ranging from a slight tottering gait to \\ncomplete loss of power and inability to walk Loss of power and wasting \\nof the hindquarter may also be caused by tapeworm So long as the dog \\ncan use his limbs he should be given regular gentle exercise The food \\nmust be nourishing and rather laxative Oatmeal porridge mixed with a \\nstrong beef or mutton broth every other day will

will suffice at this time A deficiency of \\nlimesalts as a consequence of disturbances of digestion excessive forma \\ntion of carbonic acid or lactic acid which would dissolve the limesalts an \\nalteration of the general nutritive condition on account of abnormal influ \\nences in young animals enlargement and an increase in the number and \\nsize of blood vessels in the bone tissues so that the limesalts continue to \\ncirculate in the blood instead of being deposited in the bones It might \\nbe well to mention that at the present time the exact cause of this disease \\nis not known but we do know however that rickets can be developed in \\nthe dog by deficient improper food by want of nitrogenous food and espe \\ncially bones as it has been demonstrated that animals with this disease if \\ngiven these articles of diet seem to improve in a short time This disease \\ngenerally makes its appearance in young animals in the first few months \\nof their lives and for this reason also it is very often spoken of as heredi \\ntary The disease seems to develop relatively in proportion to their growth \\nif the animal grows quickly the disease will appear quicKly if growth is

have no owner the poor fellows you so \\noften see â€” homeless and friendless â€” on the streets many such I see and \\nwhile they lack pedigree yet they are dogs and should find some one \\nwho

apply ice to the head If ice is not obtainable cold water \\nplentifully applied is the next best thing to do Also give a little whisky \\n\\nSpinal Meningitis â€” The cause of this disease may be traced to injur \\nies to the spine violent blows shocks falls from windows etc \\n\\nOccasionally we see this symptom in distemper \\n\\nThe symptoms appear slowly or quickly according to the irritation \\npresent If the spinal cord is much involved by the exudation we find \\ncomplete paralysis posterior to that portion of the spine affected \\n\\nSymptoms â€” The patient is heavy and dull with a staggering gait \\nsideways on their hind quarters If the paralysis is complete we must look \\nfor the injury in the cervical region or region of the neck If a pin be \\nused to the paralyzed members there is usually no sensitiveness Coldness \\nis another symptom There is often complete paralysis or loss of power \\nto control the urine and there is a difficulty in the passage of faecal \\nmatter The paralyzed members become atrophied from want of use \\n\\nConsciousness is not at all impaired and the appetite remains fairly \\ngood \\n\\nThe prognosis is usually unfavorable and when recovery does take \\nplace it is very slow \\n\\nTreatment consists in counterirritation to the spine as biniodide of \\nmercury or mustard oil and strychnine in increasing doses commencing \\nwith 150 grain three times a day increased gradually to 130 Iodide of \\npotash may be used in conjunction with the strychnine Electricity may \\nbe tried \\n\\nTemperature and PuLse â€” As indications of health or departure from \\nthe normal state the temperature and the moisture or dryness of the nose \\nâ€” the integument forming the walls of the nostrils â€” are very delicate indi \\ncators but if I may say so they tell too much and are too general and \\ndo not enable us to discriminate When the nose is dry and hot we know \\nthe dog is out of sorts but we have to search for other symptoms to deter \\nmine what is the matter The pulse and general temperature are impor \\ntant aids to diagnosis far too much neglected Dalziel says \\n\\nThe first thing a medical man does when he visits a patient is to feel \\nthe pulse and if there is a suspicion of fever of any kind the temperature \\nof the body is carefully taken this course if followed with the dog would \\nassist the owner in treating his animal in all inflammatory and febril cases \\nsuch as distemper \\n\\nA dogs pulse varies from 90 to 100 beats per minute the hearts \\naction being quicker in highly bred nervous dogs as for instance setters \\npointers and bulldogs and some finely bred toys The owner should for \\n\\n\\n144 â€â€” iâ€” \\n\\nthis reason become familiar with the temperature of his dog in health \\nso that he may be able to at once detect a departure from the normal \\nstate You can feel the pulse inside the knee but in small doga It ia \\nbetter to count the heart beats If you hold the left foreleg up with \\nelbow slightly bent the point of it will indicate the place where the hand \\nshould be held flat over it \\n\\nThe temperature is gauged by inserting an ordinary clinical ther \\nmometer in the rectum for half a minute or in the mouth between the \\nlip and teeth although the latter can only be done on a quiet subject The \\ntemperature of the dog normally varies from 100 degrees to 101 Fahren \\nheit \\n\\nTetanus â€” See Lockjaw \\n\\nTesticles Enlarged â€” When this occurs acute pain Is in most casea \\npresent while in other cases it seems to cause but little if any inconven \\nience Dogs past the middle age are usually the subjects and obesity pre \\ndisposes this condition Dogs which have not been allowed to be bred are \\nalso so affected but it occurs quite often in stud dogs as well also due to \\ninjuries In treating such cases try to remove the cause if you can so \\nascertain If pain is present hot fomentations should be applied and an \\naperient given \\n\\nThorns These are most liable to pierce the pads of the foot the aole \\n\\nThe thorn should be abstracted at once and if a severe case of inflamma \\ntion has been caused bathe or poultice the foot \\n\\nTapeworm â€” See Worms \\n\\nTartar on the Teeth â€” See Teeth Decayed \\n\\nTears â€” See Wounds 1 \\n\\nTeeth â€” The following article on teeth could not be made plainer than \\nby what Dalziel says \\n\\nThe dog has when the set is complete or in kennel parlance when \\nhe has a full mouth fortytwo teeth made up of twelve inciaora or cut \\nting teeth four canines or fangs and twentysix molars double or grind \\ning teeth \\n\\nSome of these constitute what are ordinarily called the milk teeth \\nand are deciduous that is to say they are after a few niontha cast and \\ngive place to permanent ones \\n\\nThe Incisors â€” six above and six below â€” form the front teeth those \\nIn the upper jaw are the larger and both above and below the center teeth \\nare the smaller the outer or corner cutters the strongest these appear \\nat the age of from four to five weeks and give place to the permanent In \\ncisors at three to four months \\n\\nThe Canines or Fangs also make their appearance when the pup is \\nfrom four to six weeks old and these are replaced by the permanent fangs \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout the age of five or six months they are considerably elongated and \\npointed the upper ones are the stronger \\n\\nThe Molars â€” Of these twelve are in the upper jaw and fourteen in \\nthe lower the first that is of course the four two upper and two under \\nare not deciduous and make their appearance at about three or four months \\nthe second third in the upper and fourth in the lower are like the in \\ncisors and canines deciduous appearing at the fourth or fifth week and \\ngiving place to the permanent ones at five to six months the fourth in the \\nupper jaw is much the strongest and in the lower jaw the fifth is the \\nlargest and strongest The fifth generally appears from the fourth to the \\nfifth month and in the lower jaw the fifth is the largest and strongest The \\nsixth at the age of from five to six months and the seventh in the lower jaw \\nfrom five and a half to seven months Most of the molars in the lower jaw \\nfrom five and a half to seven months Most of the molars whilst adapted \\nfor grinding or crushing bones etc are terminated by acute lobes suitable \\nfor tearing flesh \\n\\nTartar Accumulation Upon the Teeth â€” This term is applied to those \\nblackish incrustations so commonly found adhering around the necks of the \\nteeth It is by far the commonest in pet dogs or those which are chiefly \\nfed upon soft food Sometimes the accumulation of matter is so great that \\nit causes the teeth to become loose leads to ulceration of the gums and \\nthe production of a most offensive smell from the mouth all of which can \\nbe obviated by giving the animal an occasional bone to pick The treatment \\nmust be directed to the removal of the tartar deposit This can be done by \\nputting on a simple tape muzzle and then scraping the teeth with a small \\ninstrument which is sold by most cutlers for the purpose of scraping the \\nnails of the human subject It is a somewhat tedious operation neverless \\nextremely simple \\n\\nCare must be taken to prevent the gums from injury as they are very \\nsoft and bleed upon the slightest touch in many cases All loose and \\ndecayed teeth should be pulled out and the mouth washed occasionally for \\nseveral days with some cleansing fluid such as \\n\\nPotash alum Vz dram \\n\\nBorax Vz dram \\n\\nPermanganate of potash 16 grains \\n\\nWater 4 ounces \\n\\nDirectons â€” Apply to the teeth with a brush \\n\\nThe dog must have an occasional aperient i e a laxative of a mild \\nkind and there is nothing better than half to one teaspoonful of liquid \\nextract of cascara bark in a little water \\n\\nBroken Teeth â€” The teeth are liable to injury from various causes \\nsuch as result from biting hard substances like stone etc Unless they \\ncause inconvenience through sharp projecting points lacerating the tongue \\netc or imperfect mastication of food they are best left alone In old dogs \\nthe teeth are sometimes worn almost away and such it is advisable to feed \\non soft food \\n\\nDisplaced Teeth â€” The permanent teeth may be displaced either \\n\\nthrough a temporary tooth not having been shed or by an excessive ac \\ncumulation of tartar If caused by the former this should be extracted \\nthe latter should be scaled off according to the method already recom \\nmended Tooth forceps can be had at surgical instrument makers \\n\\nCaries or Diseased Teeth â€” The fangs are those teeth which are com \\nmonly affected One or more of the teeth appear brown with a black center \\nperhaps coated with tartar and loose The breath is very offensive and \\nsaliva is constantly dribbling from the mouth sometimes swellings under \\nthe jaw The sooner the decayed tooth or teeth is removed the better \\nfollowed by a gentle laxative and Vxe adoption of such methods as will \\nkeep the system in good working order â€” viz careful dietary \\n\\nAbscess of the Jaw â€” A decayed tooth may give rise to the formation \\nof matter below the jaw in which case there appears a soft sort of tumor \\nswelling If this is neglected a fistulous ulcer may remain \\n\\nIn some cases the jawbone itself may become involved in the dis \\neaser state but fortunately this is rare The gums are red swollen and \\nspongy The breath is very fetid and offensive \\n\\nThe term canker of the mouth has been and still is applied to this \\nand other diseases of the mouth \\n\\nThe treatment consists of removing the diseased tooth fomenting the \\nabscess below the jaw with hot water and when ripe either opening it with \\na sharp knife lancet or allowing it to burst itself After the matter has \\nescaped it should along with the mouth be washed out with chloride of \\nzinc or lead lotion four grains to every ounce of water The system will \\nrequire good support and it may be a course of tonics such as a grain or \\ntwo of quinine night and morning in the form of a pill or using one of \\nthe Condition Pills you see advertised in this book â€” Claytons Dents or \\nSergeants â€” they are all good made by dogmen for dogs and you wont go \\namiss in using either of them in such cases \\n\\nTeeth Decayed â€” It is unfortunately only too true that the condition \\nof a dogs teeth does not receive the attention that it should this is very \\nevident when it is borne in mind that one of the most important functions \\nof the teeth is mastication and that an animal cannot maintain good health \\nif it is imperfectly performed Upon sound teeth greatly depends perfect \\nmastication Before assimilation of the food can take place in the stomach \\nit must be received into that organ in a fit condition for the process and \\nthis depends upon the condition of the teeth When the food is not prop \\nerly chewed it acts as an irritant to the stomach and bowels causing indi \\ngestion and diarrhea which latter in puppies often proves fatal \\n\\nGenerally speaking the teeth do not receive any attention until they \\ndecay and cause pain or stomach trouble Preventative measures are in \\nmy experience seldom taken though it is quite as necessary for a dog to \\nhave clean teeth as it is for ourselves \\n\\nThe teeth especially require attention in the case of dogs which are \\nfed upon an unsuitable diet as they become furred and finally accumtila \\ntions of tartar exist To avoid this they should be gone over once a day \\nwith an ordinary toothbrush dipped into weak Condys Fluid This will not \\nonly prevent decay but also keeps the breath sweet a most important mat \\nter where the dog is ones constant companion Fetid breath however is \\nnot always

brush That dogs are \\nfrequently the subject of toothache cannot be doubted and is clearly shown \\nby the swelling of the cheek and often by the formation of abscesses All \\ndecayed teeth that are past preserving should be extracted by a competent \\nperson \\n\\nTurnside â€” The dog has no fit in this disease but walks about appar \\nently without an object generally in circles and always in one direction \\nYouatt ascribes the disease to the presence of hytadids in the brain but \\nresults of more recent study of animal parasites are opposed to this view \\nWorms in the stomach or intestines is more likely to be the cause Give \\nthe dog a few doses of Sure Shot Glovers Dents or Claytons Vermifugs \\nAlso put the dog in a room or small kennel yard where he can not injure \\nhimself by running against things as he might due to his sight being im \\npaired \\n\\nTumors â€” These are divided into groups of varying structure â€” Fi \\nbrous Fatty Calcareous Melanotic Osseous and Lacteal \\n\\nFibrous Tumors are usually situated in the jaw or limbs they have a \\nfirm attachment and are hard and insensible to the touch Excision is ne \\ncessary In the centre of these tumors a cyst or cavity containing serum \\nor matter pus often exists and in consequence abscesses form upon \\ntheir surface \\n\\nFatty Tumors are commonly met with in the dog and have no particu \\nlar position but occur at any part of the body They are smooth and shiny \\nupon their surface unattached to the surrounding tissues they seldom be \\ncome inflamed and are not tender when touched The treatment is by \\nexcision \\n\\nCalcareous Tumors â€” These are common in bitches and are usually \\nsituated in the mammary glands The treatment is by excision external \\napplications being of no avail \\n\\nMelanotic Tumors are seldom seen in canine practice There are a \\nfew cases on record and with them excision has been successful \\n\\nOsseous Tumors are likewise rare in dogs and when occurring are \\ninvariably associated with rickets their situation is the limbs \\n\\nLacteal Tumors have already been fully dealt with under that head \\ning \\n\\nTongue Inflammation of Glossitis â€” Dogs are extremely liable to \\nInjuries of the tongue which is not surprising when we consider the variety \\nof articles they pick up â€” sharp pieces of bone or stone In some instances \\nthe inflammation is due to a sting I have known one or two cases of this \\nin terriers while the teeth sometimes cause lacerations \\n\\nThe symptoms are first an increase of saliva the jaws are moved con \\nstantly and upon examination the tongue is found to be inflamed and ten \\nder swallowing is performed with difficulty thirst is present or at least \\nthe animal finds relief in continually lapping although probably not much \\np swallowed The mouth should be rinsed out frequently throughout the \\n\\nday with a solution of boracic acid 1 scr of the acid to G oz of water \\nTo do this hold the head down slightly pour the liquid in one side and \\nallow it to run out of the other If a little is swallowed it is of no con \\nsequence A weak solution of Condys Fluid can also be used in the same \\nway with marked benefit This treatment with an aperient is usually all \\nthat is necessary If the inflammation is due to injuries caused by the \\nteeth the latter must have attention they may require extraction The \\nfood must consist for a time of warm milk or gravy Chicken gravy or \\nmade from giblets with flour added is very nourishing and many dogs \\nthat are sick will eat this when refusing everything else Egg and milk to \\nlap may also suit them and it is good \\n\\nTongue Paralysis of â€” Occasionally seen in dogs and often congenital \\nThe tongue protrudes becomes dry and often cracks The dog experiences \\nlittle inconvenience and laps with ease If cracks appear on the tongue \\napply a little boracic acid ointment which is nonpoisonous while a little \\nsweet oil on the tongue will prevent the dryness A nerve tonic should be \\ngiven 5 to 20 drops as per sized dog of the tincture of Nux Vomica with \\nVz grain to 1 grain of quinine is a very good thing to use now given in \\nwater twice daily after food \\n\\nTongue Ulcers on the â€” A very painful condition usually the result of \\nneglect the teeth having been allowed to accumulate tartar The ulcers \\nmay be quite rough on decayed teeth or to a disordered stomach this fre \\nquently the cause In this case give an aperient give a plain diet and in \\nmoderate quantities and when the condition of the stomach improves the \\nulcers disappear Remove the tartar by scaling and rub the teeth after \\nwards with a tooth brush dipped into a weak solution of Condys Fuid \\nExtract the decayed teeth if any Touch the ulcers lightly with nitrate \\nof silver \\n\\nTicks resemble in appearance a spider to which in fact they are re \\nlated varying in size from a pins head to a small pea The tick fastens \\nin the skin by means of its legs holding on with as much tenacity as fre \\nquently to part in two in the attempt to remove it They are less common \\nand less known than either the flea or louse The color of the smaller ones \\nis a light grey but become dark when gorged with blood from the dog \\nMy Skin Cure will also destroy these pests but you must rub it in well \\nto kill them and all over the body In using it after leaving on the dog \\nfor fifteen minutes you can then rinse off and dry the dog thus getting \\nrid of the greasy condition of the coat Ticks occasionally occur even in \\nthe best regulated kennels as it is of course impossible to prevent a dog \\nsometimes coming in contact with other dogs so infected Once ticks make \\ntheir appearance lose no time in ridding the dog of them \\n\\nWarts are rather common on the dog occurring on the lips ears in \\nside of the mouth and appear singly or in clusters They can be removed \\nby a ligature tied tightly around the root as close to the skin as possible \\nAnother method is by ft scalpel the blade held fiat on the skin at the root \\n\\n\\nof the wart â€” cut through â€” the raw surface being then cauterized The \\nhot iron or actual cautery although for the time the most painful is after \\nall says Dalziel the best and safest Neither potasse fusse nitric acid or \\nnitrate of silver can be safely used because the dogs tongue would surely \\nsweep the injured lip the consequence being the caustic in part would be \\ntransferred to the tongue which would peel as the result If used the jaws \\nmust be so tightly bound that the teeth are held together so the tongue \\ncannot protrude \\n\\nThe warts often grow in clusters and the difficulty of dealing with \\nthem then is greatly increased An application of bicarbonate of soda has \\nproved effectual in some cases \\n\\n\\nNORMACOT WHITE KING the American Major Mite \\n\\nPremiership Winner of England

\\n\\nWorms â€” All dogs are born with worms some few get through without \\ntreatment like some children do but every puppy I have ever bred was \\ntreated for worms at from six to eight weeks old or as soon as they were \\nweaned and this is the only safe and sure plan to follow for you make no \\nmistake by so doing Worms are without doubt the cause of the death of \\nmore puppies in various ways than from all other diseases combined de \\nstroying life when their presence is not suspected Except in rare cases \\nthey do not do much damage until after puppy is weaned when they get \\ntheir work in and I hardly ever treat for worms under six and generally \\nnot until they are eight weeks old or just after being weaned In the last \\ntwo years however I have had puppies show signs and pass worms in con \\nsiderable quantities as young as three and in some few cases two weeks \\nold and I have then treated them with small doses of vermifuge but they \\nmust be very small doses and careful in what you use at this age for as a \\nrule very little medicine should be given to a puppy before it is weaned To \\nbe safe and sure you do not need to wait for the usual signs of worms in \\npuppies but just make up your mind to the fact that all pups are born with \\nworms â€” and you wont miss it When you buy a puppy find out If it has \\nbeen treated if not do so at once for you can be sure it has them and \\nproper remedies are now made that are perfectly safe to use and harmless \\nshould puppy not have any worms \\n\\nThere are several worm remedies made for dogs that are safe and re \\nliable When I have to give puppies treatment for worms before they are \\nweaned I have used Claytons Vermifuge in small doses and with good \\nsuccess see what he says in his ad as to this and also Vermilax see \\nVermilax Cos ad also Both this and Claytons are in liquid form and \\ncan graduate the dose easily As some remedies are put up in capsules \\nthat would be too heavy a dose for puppies and even older small toy \\ndogs An overdose might not kill the dog but would of course make it \\nsick I also use Sergeants Sure Shot and have for years as it was got \\nten up by my old friend Polk Miller It is put up in liquid form also in \\ncapsules In the liquid form you can give small doses using judgement \\nas to age and breed I also used for a long time Glovers Vermifuge \\nand it is an old and reliable remedy all right for grown dogs and larger \\nbreeds but a little too strong for puppies and toy dogs unless in small doses \\n\\nThere are several remedies advertised as quick workers some claiming \\nthirty and sixty minute results and I am afraid this Is too quick to be \\n\\nsafe as they may contain Areca Nut a dangerous drug to ever use as it \\nshoots through the dog like lightning but if any of it remains in the dog \\nit means inflamation of the intestines and most always a dead dog It is \\na very old remedy too old used in years gone by when they did not know \\nso much as we do now In my article against Tape Worms I warned against \\nthe use of Areca Nut \\n\\nBetter give too small a dose than an over dose of any Vermifuge \\nand give it oftener or as long as you see signs of the dog having worms \\nThe three principle kinds that infest dogs are \\n\\nFirst â€” The Common Round or Stomach Worm of a pale pink or flesh \\ncolor pointed at both ends and from two to six inches long in appearance \\nvery much like the common earth or fish worm this kind is most common \\nin puppies \\n\\nSecond â€” The Tape Worm which is made up of flat sections joined to \\ngether and these sections being from a quarter to an inch in length and \\nin color nearly white the tail being the largest and longest section which \\ngradually gets smaller and shorter toward the head to such an extent that it \\nlooks to the naked eye as fine as a thread Under a strong glass this part \\nwill look like a lot of very small beads strung on a fine thread Here is \\nwhere to look for the head which is described by Stonehenge as follows \\nThe head is small and generally hemispherical broader than long and \\noften as truncated anteriorly the four mouths or oscula are situated \\non the anterior surface and surround the central rostellum which is very \\nshort terminated by a minute opical papilla and surrounded by a double \\ncircle of small recurved hooks The head can seldom be seen or found \\nwith the naked eye It is larger than the neck but yet too small to be \\nseen unless under a glass \\n\\nThird â€” The Maw Worm or pin or thread worm as it is variously \\ncalled is located in the rectum and is nearly pink in color and from a \\nhalf to an inch long These are the least dangerous of all worms but \\ncause great irritation They are passed adhering to the feces In puppies \\nthese sometimes cause partial paralysis which disappears after the worms \\nare passed Some authors claim that the maw worm are segments of the \\ntape worm but I think it is a separate species altogether The common \\nround stomach worms which inhabit the stomach and small intestines are \\nmost to be feared of all being more peculiar to puppies causing irritation \\nof the stomach and intestines indigestion fits diarrhea and obstruction \\nof the bowels Your puppy has a much greater chance to live when the \\nworms are gotten rid of as their presence leads to so many dangerous \\ncomplications \\n\\nFourth â€” Hook Worms â€” these you will find treated under a special \\narticle elsewhere \\n\\nDalziel says The varieties of worms Infesting dogs are very num \\nerous far more so than dog owners in general have the slightest idea of \\nbut some varieties fortunately are rare A variety has been found in the \\neye another in the nasal sinuses where it causes great irritation the cruel \\nThread Worm finds its way into the heart producing a most painful death \\nBorne are found in the blood the liver has its parasite so have the kid \\nney and urethra \\n\\nAs has been the custom of writers and owners of dogs to classify them \\n\\n\\n1under the headings of roundworm mawworm and tapeworm I have \\nin this article done the same as these are the kinds that mostly concern \\ndog owners \\n\\nSymptoms of Stomach Worms in young puppies are plain to be seen \\nthey pass them also vomit them up they cause Diarrhea and you will \\nfind mucus or slime and sometimes blood in the passage You will also \\nnotice a distension and hardness of the stomach very much disproportion \\nate to amount of food they have eaten and you may notice the puppy drag \\nging itself on its stern or biting at its tail In older dogs most of these \\nsame symptoms appear as well as others here enumerated a foul breath \\nnose is hot and dry hacking cough fits vomiting of their food mixed with \\nmucus rough and staring coat indigeston disturbed sleep colic pains and \\nemaciation \\n\\nThe question is often asked at what period after service should a \\nbitch be treated for worms or rather how soon before whelping A fort \\nnight or three weeks is about the limit after service but they have been \\ntreated without bad result within three weeks of whelping \\n\\nIf you have your puppies confined in a yard it is very easy to watch \\ntheir passages and this is one of the surest ways of all then as soon as \\nyou see mucus or worms passed you know they have them and can go to \\nwork at once to treat them Now as to stomach or round worms â€” if they \\nappear before pups are weaned in such quantities that you deem it advis \\nable or safest to treat as it most generally is select the vermifuge you \\nwish to use and then be guided as to size of dose and age of puppy \\n\\nNow here on this most important subject of Worms I want to say all \\nthe good I can for the sake of saving the puppies You will find advertised \\nin this book worm remedies made by Glover Clayton Polk Miller and the \\nVermilax Company and the C S R Remedy Co Look them up in the \\nvery interesting and valuable lot of advertisements you will find in this \\nbook as beneficial and important even if they are advertisements and \\npaid for to insert as in using these already prepared vermifuges you \\ncannot go amiss if their directions and what I say as to administering them \\nis followed I have used every one of them and it is far better to use \\nsome one of these well known worm remedies that are made for dogs by \\nreliable and experienced parties in treating dogs than to take chances or \\ngo to the trouble of having other prescriptions filled I am not getting \\npaid extra to recommend anyones vermifuge for I would not do so unless \\nI thought and believed the article would save puppies â€” my main object \\nin this book being to do good to dogs I could give you â€” as most dog \\nbooks do give â€” a lot of prescriptions but only give one so that in case \\nyou do not happen to have on hand or cannot get one of these mentioned \\nthen you could get this one filled and use till you could order one of the \\nothers Right here I want to say â€” never use areca nut for worms in any \\nform or any vermifuge that contains this dangerous drug if you know \\nit for while it expels the worms by the fast train route it also kills \\nmore dogs by far than it ever saves Areca nut is a relic of a past decade \\nâ€” avoid its use \\n\\nThe following article on Symptoms of Worms was published in Field \\nand Fancy I think written by F J Skinner and certainly worthy of \\nspace in this book \\n\\nWhat are the symptoms by which it can be determined that a dog \\nIs suffering from worms As regards puppies the symptoms are very \\nclear \\n\\nThey begin to get thin and they have an appearance that can best \\nbe described by the not very euphonious or deiicate but certainly vivid \\ndescription of potbellied \\n\\nThis means that the round worms with which they become infested \\ndevelop to such an extent as to give them a hanging appearance which \\nevery one that has had experience in raising puppies will speedily recognize \\nas symptomatic of the presence of worms \\n\\nThe puppies become very voracious yet do not seem to thrive and in \\na majority of cases they have fits and unless relief be given very soon \\nthey will die In these fits \\n\\nAnother symptom is diarrhoea which of course is due to the irritated \\ncondition of the intestines \\n\\nThe administration of worm medicine in any shape or form how \\never simple to puppies is always attended with no small amount of risk \\nand for this reason as it seems to us â€” that the effect of a mild dose of \\nmedicine is simple to stir up the worms when a puppy is badly infested \\nwhich is practically as bad as giving an overstrong dose \\n\\nThe mild dose stirs them up and causes a fit when the overstrong dose \\nmay have what is practically a poisonous effect Repeat the dose in a mild \\ner form in about a week and then it will be safe to assume that the puppy \\nhas been cleared entirely After this take the precaution to give from time \\nto time some little laxative medicine In this way you can effectively \\nprevent the development of worms to any serious extent and so there will \\nnot be any further need for the stronger vermifuges which are required \\nwhen a puppy is badly infested \\n\\nThe following are among the many symptomatic indications of worms \\n\\nThe Eyes â€” Pupils almost constantly dilated the eyelids nearly closed \\nas though aching which is aggravated by motion sensitive to light the \\nwhites of eyes red and in jested patient acts as though sight were de \\nfective being guarded in its movements eyeballs roll about in distorted \\nfashion opacity of the lens and amaurotic conditions \\n\\nThe Nose â€” Great irritation evidenced by frequent rubbing on the \\nground or with the paws \\n\\nThe Tongue â€” The dorsum centrally coated with yellow fur on the \\nsides appear round or oval spots of a pink or deep crimson color occasion \\nally slightly elevated when vomiting and diarrhoea are present accom \\npaniments and spots are observed through the coating of fur \\n\\nThe Mouth â€” Dribbling of slimy saliva especially during sleep breath \\nfetid and very offensive frequent grinding of the teeth both when asleep \\nand awake \\n\\nCough â€” Dry short and spasmodic \\n\\nAppetite â€” Capricious depraved frequently ravenous occasionally in \\nabeyance \\n\\nHeart â€” Palpitation violence and irregular action sharp pains indn \\ncated by crying out and biting at the ribs over tiie seat of heart very \\nrapid breathing \\n\\nAbdomenfSwollen and hard to the touch griping pains indicated \\n\\n\\n168 r \\n\\nby rolling about lying on stomach with outstretched legs flatulenc \\nvoniition \\n\\nAnus â€” Considerable local irritation indicated by dragging along on \\nthe hindquarters protrusion of the mucous membrane and prolapse of the \\nparts \\n\\nSkin â€” Coat rough stands on end abundant scurf herpetic eruptions \\nthick and lacking usual pliability \\n\\nFoeces â€” Constipated with frequent ineffective efforts to pass coated \\nwith slimy mucus or loose papescent mixed with slimy mucus great \\nstraining dark colored sometimes bloody and very offensive discharges \\nof slimy mucus only are frequently observable at such times evacuations \\nare white or greenish attended with much straining \\n\\nUrine â€” Passed with difficulty pale or milky appearance or whit \\nand thick passed involuntarily \\n\\nNervous System â€” Convulsions cramps paralysis giddiness irritabil \\nity sleeplessness depression restlessness suddenly jumps up out of sleep \\nwhines and cries out a with fear epilepy chorea \\n\\nThe presence of worms naturally tends to reduce a dog in condition \\nand many dogs remain permanently so until a thorpugh dosing is given \\nthem which is effective in ridding them of the nuisance \\n\\nAs to worms it is never necessary to consult a veterinarian in fact \\nsafer not to do so as too many of them prescribe and use medicines that \\nare dangerous have to be given too often and in too large quantities In \\ncase you are where you cannot get the vermifuges I have mentioned and \\ncannot wait till you could get them then here is a prescription for worms \\n\\nOil of male shield fern 1 dram \\n\\nSantonine 8 grains \\n\\nFluid extract of jalap 1 ounce \\n\\nOlive oil 1 ounce \\n\\nOil of anise 20 drops \\n\\nDose for puppies two to four months old one and a half teaspoons \\nful seven to ten months old two and grown dogs two and a half \\nor three teaspoonfuls given on an empty stomach \\nr \\n\\nAbove doses are for dogs that weigh when grown from 50 pounds \\nto 100 pounds For smaller dogs weighing about 25 pounds take two \\nthirds and toy dogs of about 10 pounds take onethird the above doses \\nIn treating puppies with this remedy give only one dose on old dogs re \\npeat once or twice \\n\\nThere is no use giving any worm remedy unless the dog has been \\nprepared for it by a proper fasting and the medicine is put in them when \\nbowels are empty You must catch the worms by fishing for them when \\nthey are hungry the exception of this rule being of course in the case of \\ntreating puppies yet unweaned This is as before said not so often ne \\ncessary \\n\\nDr Clayton furnishes me directions as to giving his Vermifuge as \\nfollows The dose for toy dog ten days old is two to five drops twenty \\ndays old fiv to ten drops thirty days old ten to thirty drops Medium and \\n\\nlarge breeds twice and three times the amount to be varied by the size \\nand strength of the animal and can be given with perfect safety I have \\nyet to see one unpleasant result of the Vermifuge and I will pay for any \\npup that has been properly treated with my Vermifuge in time that dies \\nof worms I will put up twice the value of the pup and after I have given \\na dose of my Vermifuge if the pup dies and there is found one worm the \\nowner takes the money if there are no worms the owner stands the loss \\nI absolutely guarantee to remove all worms with my remedies without \\ninjury to the animal and you cannot speak too highly of my worm reme \\ndies \\n\\nDr Clayton further says Puppies never do so well as when get \\nting the nourishment from the mother and if it is possible to rid them of \\nworms at this tme it is very much to be desired this can be accomplished \\nby giving Claytons Vermifuge as it is a safe remedy and can be given to \\npuppies at ten days old any breed The Vermifuge should never be given \\noftener than once a week It is a good plan to give all puppies the Vermi \\nfuge say once a week from ten days old until they are three months old \\nas you are then absolutely sure your puppies are free from worms and \\nbarring all contagious diseases will soon arrive at the teething period \\n\\nNow what I have written and furnished you in the foregoing is meant \\nfor Stomach or Round Worms especally Any of these Vermifuges might \\nalso expel tape worm but I now treat of it and a remedy that is certain \\nsafe and sure one made and intended to be used on humans for tape \\nworm but adapted to and used on the dog by the writer \\n\\nTape Worm â€” Symptoms of Tape Worm â€” An irregular and frequently \\na ravenous appetite coexisting with considerable emaciation the food taken \\nseeming to do the dog no good The breath is offensive and nose hot and \\ndry The coat has a rough harsh staring unhealthy look the hair looking \\ndead I have however found tape worms in a pug dog that had a sleek \\nand glossy coat and was fat and healthy They often have a depraved ap \\npetite looking for and eating filth Parts of the worm may sometimes be \\nseen hanging from the anus of the dog this being the case in the pug spoken \\nof and who had never shown any signs of having such trouble as she was \\na bitch that had had several litters of pups \\n\\nI prefer mixing it in molasses as this is sweet and also a physic It \\nshould work him in from half an hour to an hour but sometimes takes \\nlonger \\n\\nAnother way to give it is by mixing the powder in castor or olive oil \\nthe way it is given by doctors in treating human beings for tape worm \\n\\nNow arrange to have it so you can examine the passages by dog being \\nconfined in a yard Be there yourself till it has worked the dog dont give \\nit up and go away for this catching tape worms is not easy fishing and you \\nmust give it your attention Examine each stool and carefully pick out \\nthe part of worm it may contain wash this off and put it on a sheet of \\npaper so you can examine it and see what luck you had in that haul or if \\nyou got the head that time You can buy at a small cost a magnifying glass \\nas the head cannot be seen with the naked eye As soon as medicine is \\nthrough working feed up your dog for he will relish a good meal If you \\nfind the head then I would let the dog go for a week before you give him \\n\\nanother dose but if you have not found the head then repeat dose in two \\nor three days \\n\\nIn tape worm cases the treatment must be repeated and persevered \\nwith until the head of the worm is expelled and in all cases the worms and \\nall discharged feces should be either burned or destroyed by mixing it with \\nsome powerful disinfectant and then buried to prevent propagation of the \\nparasites by their ova \\n\\nYou may get one worm or more and yet the dog may have more tape \\nworms which treat for later on if symptoms again appear Here is another \\nprescription which is recommended by Dalzel \\n\\nTreatment for Tape Worm â€” I will now divulge the secret of the rem \\nedy that I have sold for years under the name of Eberharts Tape Worm \\nRemedy and which has never failed and never will fail to remove tape \\nworms head and all if directions are followed Kamala is the article It \\nis a product of India a fine granular powder of a reddish brown color \\nobtained from the minute glands adhering to the capsules of Rottlera \\ntinctoria \\n\\nSome ten years ago my pug Boycott was afflicted with tape worm not \\nonly one but several as is sometimes the case and I tried every known \\nremedy and each case failed to rid him of the worms besides nearly ruin \\ning the dog I paid one tape worm doctor who treated people ten dollars \\nto work on my dog one entire day and lie faied to get the head of the \\nworm and the poor dog was sick for many days afterward due to the \\nsevere ordeal and treatment I then discovered Kamala which had been \\nused for human beings and in less than a week I had removed three tape \\nworms including heads aggregating eighty feet in length \\n\\nKamala is entirely harmless never causing irritation or inflammation \\nand unlike other remedies its use does not leave the patient in a weakened \\ncondition but exactly the reverse in this respect â€” the dog feeling better \\nis braced up acts happy and better than before taking it So harmless do \\nI know it to be that many times I have given it as an ordinary physic \\nwhen I did not have castor oil on hand It is the greatest tape worm \\nremedy ever used and I now give up the secret purely for the good of dogs \\nas I have sold it for years and am receiving orders for it almost daily \\nit having been a profitable part of my business \\n\\nIt is also a very good remedy for removing round worms Being a com \\nparatively new remedy at this writing not all druggists keep it and espe \\ncially in smaller towns and if your druggist has not got it send to me \\nand I can mail it to you as my druggist in Cincinnati keeps it in stock \\nand

\\na deadly and dangerous remedy \\n\\nHow to Use Kamala \\n\\nFast your dog for twentyfour hours a day and a night and then in \\n\\n\\n160 \\n\\nthe morning give him the dose A strong and mature dog should be kept \\nwithout food for twentyfour hours weakly dogs and puppies a less period \\nbut sufficient to empty the stomach for it is no use giving vermifuge on a \\nfull stomach except to young puppies of course \\n\\nWeigh your dog and if he is ordinarily strong and healthy the size \\ndose to give is two grains for each pound the dog weighs If the dog is \\nnot in usual health or is a weakly sort try it first â€” one and a half grains \\nto each pound Kamala is tasteless and unless the dog gets the idea you \\nare giving him medicine it is easily administered as follows I give it \\nmixed in molasses and then put it in his mouth rubbing whatever is left \\non your finger on his nose and he will lick it off himself \\n\\nIn using Kamala should you give an overdose no harm will result \\nfrom it as it is not a drug An even teaspoonful of Kamala is sixty grains \\nand taking this as a guide you can come near enough to the proper dose \\nfor any dog if you have the dogs weight as for instance if your dog \\nweighed sixty pounds then the dose would be two teaspoonfuls and you \\ncan get at it this way or a better plan is to get your druggist to weigh it \\nout into proper sized doses telling him weight of dog and that the dose \\nis two grains to each pound dog weighs \\n\\nYou may find difficulty in getting Kamala many druggists not keep \\ning it and some of them even not knowing as to it and if you cannot \\nobtain it of your druggist I can send it to you by mail two hundred and \\nforty grains for fifty cents It must be fresh and what you do not use \\nmust be kept in a tight glass stoppered bottle to retain its virtues for fu \\nture use Kamala is the greatest tape worm remedy of all I am satis \\nfied and sure that it is and since I first made it public in my second edi \\ntion of this book several makers of worm remedies are using it in their \\nworm preparations One regular physician in Mississippi who had prac \\nticed medicine for forty years and who bred hounds not knowing of \\nKamala ordered it and later wrote me that from one dog he got eighty \\ntwo feet of tape worm and that he should adopt and use Kamala here \\nafter in his practice on humans \\n\\nDalziel says of Tape Worms â€” These are as the name indicates the \\nflat worms which are often seen evacuated with the feces in small sections \\nof half an inch or less when they are usually called mawworms or at \\ntimes chains of them may be seen hanging from the anus when being \\nexpelled naturally or under the action of medicine \\n\\nNo less than a dozen tapeworms select the dog as their host They \\nhave a remarkable lifehistory and it is as well for the dog owner to \\nknow something as to this as he is often puzzled to think how this or \\nthat dog became infested \\n\\nIt will therefore be well to see how an adult tape worm is made up \\nIf examined it will be found to consist of a head or scolex and a series \\nof segments scientifically known as metameres These latter are con \\nstantly being budded off from the head and assume forms varying with \\ntheir age Thus those nearest the head are the youngest and those at \\nthe other extremity the oldest It is these last which one sees from time \\nto time pass with the faecal discharges They are in fact the ripe segments \\nor proglottids which detach themselves from the hind portion and each \\nportion thus freed is endowed with reproductive organs In tim these \\n\\n\\nâ \\n\\ndetached portions die away but the eggs contained In them have been \\nimpregnated by spermatozoa and simply await another host to begin anew \\nthe cycle of existence The eggs thus scattered broadcast are not influ \\nâ€ enced by extremes of heat or cold dryness or moisture nor does time seem \\nto destroy their germinating power From this it will readily be seen \\nhow important it is to burn all excreta from dogs infested with tape worms \\nWhen the ripe segments leave the dog per anus they are charged with \\nova and possessing the power of motion wriggle among the hair where \\nthe lice and fleas devour the eggs and develop into the cryptocysts found \\nby Grassi free in the abdominal cavity The dog again in searching for \\nhis tormentors nibbles and licks his skin and coat and in this way swal \\nlows the insect and when the contained cryptocyst is set free in the dogs \\nstomach the tapeworm is once more developed The nimble flea travels \\nso readily from one dog to another carrying this tape worm with him \\nthat we have here an explanation of what has puzzled so many â€” how a \\ncarefully fed and groomed house dog becomes infested with tape worm \\n\\nMaw Worms â€” Treatment for Maw Worms â€” These can be reached and \\nexpelled by the following injection per rectum Aloes 1 dram Put the \\naloes into a tea cup of warm water and then put it into a bottle Inject \\nonce every day until no more are to be seen passing from the dog Use \\nrubber syringe and hold rear part of the dog up for five minutes after \\ninjecting It will do no harm and facilitate matters by having given an \\nhour beforehand a dose of Kamala see tape worm as the Kamala will \\ngive dog a thorough cleaning out and with this start expel a lot of these \\nworms The Kamala need only be given once in treating for maw worms \\nâ€” the first day you begin treating dog \\n\\nAnother good injection for rectum or maw worms is a solution of \\nquassia chips A handful steeped in water for six hours \\n\\nYellows The â€” See Jaundice and Distemper \\n\\nThe Endâ€”'"
