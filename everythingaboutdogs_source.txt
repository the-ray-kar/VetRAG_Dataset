A  PLEA  FOR  THE  DOG.  295 

SENATOR  VEST'S  FAMOUS  PLEA  OX  BEHALF  OF  THE  DOG. 


One  of  the  most  beautiful  tributes  ever  paid  to  the  dog  came  from 
the  lips  of  George  Graham  Vest,  the  distinguished  Missourian,  who  has  re- 
cently retired  to  private  life,  after  a  long  and  honorable  career  in  the 
United  States  Senate.  Senator  Vest  has  long  been  recognized  as  a  most 
forceful  and  eloquent  orator,  and  his  speeches  have  been  widely  read  for 
many  years.  It  is  doubtful,  however,  if  in  all  his  distinguished  career  he 
has  ever  made  a  speech  which  has  been  more  widely  quoted  or  universally 
appreciated  than  his  impromptu  remarks  on  the  dog,  made  many  years  ago 
in  a  country  town. 

Shortly  after  the  Civil  War,  when  he  was  a  young  man,  just  beginning 
the  practice  of  law,  and  without  the  fame  which  has  since  become  his,  he 
happened  to  be  in  attendance  upon  a  term  of  the  Johnson  County  Circuit 
Court,  at  Warrensburg,  Missouri.  A  suit  for  damages  for  the  killing  of  a 
dog  was  on  the  docket,  and  was  in  due  time  called.  Voluminous  evidence 
was  introduced  to  show  that  the  defendant  had  shot  the  dog  in  malice, 
while  other  evidence  tended  to  show  the  dog  had  attacked  the  man.  There 
were  attorneys  engaged  in  this  case,  who,  if  not  then,  have  since  become 
famous.  Senator  Vest  was  not  employed  in  the  case,  but  was  invited  to 
speak  for  the  plaintiff.  The  occasion  is  said  to  have  been  a  rare  one,  and 
his  speech  has  been  highly  praised,  and  has  gone  the  rounds  of  the  press 
for  thirty  years. 

"Gentlemen  of  the  Jury — The  best  friend  a  man  has  in  the  world  may 
turn  against  him,  and  become  his  enemy.  His  son  or  daughter  that  he 
has  reared  with  loving  care  may  prove  ungrateful.  Those  who  are  nearest 
and  dearest  to  us,  those  whom  we  trust  with  our  happiness  and  our  good 
name,  may  become  traitors  to  their  faith.  The  money  that  a  man  has  he 
may  lose.  It  flies  away  from  him,  perhaps  when  he  needs  it  most.  A  man's 
reputation  may  be  sacrificed  in  a  moment  of  ill-considered  action.  The 
people  who  are  prone  to  fall  on  their  knees  to  do  us  honor  when  success 
is  with  us,  may  be  the  first  to  throw  the  stone  of  malice  when  failure 
settles   its  cloud   upon   our   heads. 

"The  one  absolutely  unselfish  friend  that  man  can  have  in  this  selfish 
world,  the  one  that  never  deserts  him,  the  one  that  never  proves  ungrate- 
ful or  treacherous,  is  his  dog.  A  man's  dog  stands  by  him  in  prosperity 
and  in  poverty,  in  health  and  in  sickness.  He  will  sleep  on  the  cold  ground, 
where  the  wintry  winds  blow  and  the  snow  drives  fiercely,  if  only  he  may 
be  near  his  master's  side.  He  will  kiss  the  hand  that  has  no  food  to  offer; 
he  will  lick  the  wounds  and  sores  that  come  in  encounter  with  the  rough- 
ness of  the  world.  He  guards  the  sleep  of  his  pauper  master  as  if  he  were 
a  prince.  When  all  other  friends  desert  he  remains.  When  riches  take 
wings,  and  reputation  falls  to  pieces,  he  is  as  constant  in  his  love  as  the 
sun  in  its  journeys  through  the  heavens. 

"If  fortune  drives  the  master  forth  an  outcast  in  the  world,  friendless 
and  homeless,  the  faithful  dog  asks  no  higher  privilege  than  that  of  accom- 
panying him,  to  guard  him  against  danger,  to  fight  against  his  enemies. 
And  when  the  last  scene  of  all  comes,  and  death  takes  his  master  in  its 
embrace  and  his  body  is  laid  away  in  the  cold  ground,  no  matter  if  all 
other  friends  pursue  their  way,  there  by  the  graveside  will  the  noble  dog 
be  found,  his  head  between  his  paws,  his  eyes  sad,  but  open  in  alert  watch- 
fulness, faithful  and  true  even  in  death." 

The  effect  of  the  speech  is  said  to  have  held  the  court  room  audience 
spellbound,  and  when  Senator  Vest  concluded  his  remarks  there  was  not 
a  dry  eye  in  the  house.  The  case  was  submitted  to  the  jury  without  fur- 
ther argument,  and  in  a  very  few  moments  they  returned  a  verdict  in  favor 
of  the  owner  of  the  dog  for  the  full  amount  sued  for.  The  case  finally 
reached  the  Supreme  Court,  where  it  was  affirmed,  and  is  set  forth  ift  detail 
in  the  50th  Missouri  Reports. 

THE  END.

The  most  fashionable  dog  of  the  day.  Chows  are  a 
peculiar  dog,  great  thinkers,  not  much  on  the  bark,  not  easy 
to  get  acquainted  with,  (except  as  puppies).  Have  a  great 
brain,  an  exclusive  sort.  Shy  of  strangers,  but  when  you  get 
their  confidence  and  win  them  over,  you  have  secured  a  dog 
that  will  love  his  master  or  mistress  to  the  limit,  and  not 
care  much  for  anybody  else.  They  are  a  grand  watch  dog  and 
would  protect  you — be  on  duty  when  needed.

EBERHARTS  DOG  SOAP 

SUPERIOR  TO  ALL!  No  other  dog  soap  made  is  like  it. 
Contains  one  ingredient — a  secret — that  makes  it  Different 
From  All  Others.  Does  not  contain  carbolic  acid.  Is  NON- 
POISONOUS.  Eberhart's  Dog  Soap  is  made  from  a  purely 
vegetable  compound.  It  contains  no  free  alkali  or  other 
noxious  ingredient,  and  is  guaranteed  to  be  perfectly  harm- 
less to  the  coat,  skin  or  eyes  of  man  or  beast.  Any  animal 
may  lick  the  lather  off  without  injury.  It  promotes  free 
shedding  of  old  hair,  insuring  a  new  healthy  growth,  and 
leaves  the  coat  of  the  animal  soft  and  sleek.  KILLS  LICE 
and  FLEAS.  Made  as  cleanly  as  if  for  human  use,  and  for 
your  own  face  or  head,  NOTHING  IS  FINER.  Is  a  great  hair 
grower.  No  hair  tonic  made  is  better.  Cures  dandruff  or 
diseased  scalp. 

I  have  had  convincing  proofs  of  the  ill  effects  of  carbolic 
acid    and    carbolic    acid   soaps    on    dogs,    and   have    seen    that 
the  acid,  even  in  the  mild  form  of  soap,  will  poison  by  ab- 
sorption through  the  skin,  even  when  there  is  no  abrasion. 
IS  A  BLACK   SOAP,   BUT  JUST  THE  THING  FOR  WHITE 

DOGS.

Studholme  Sultan  is  a  "laster" 
himself  and  comes  from  a  family 
of  dogs  and  bitches  that  have  been 
remarkable  for  their  lasting  qual- 
ities, and  have  never  grown  thick 
and  coarse  as  so  many  strains  of 
Airedales  do.  He  is  the  shortest  coupled,  heaviest  boned  dog 
before  the  public,  and  is  a  proper  type  to  use  on  small  weedy 
bitches.     Weight   50   pounds.

STANDARD   DISINFECTANT 

A  disinfectant  of  many  years'  standing,  used  continually  by  many  of  the 
best  Kennels  in  this  country,  and  has  proven  to  be  as  good  as  any  made, 
superior  to  some,  for  all  purposes  a  disinfectant  is  needed.  See  what  the 
author  of  this  book  says,  who  has  used  it  for  years,  and  is  today  using  it. 
This  was  written  in  1902. 


FROM  AX.  G.  EBERHART,  THE  WELL  KNOWN  KENNEL  MAN, 
OF  CAMP   DENNISON,   OHIO: 

"I  received  the  one  gallon  of  your  Standard  Disinfectant ;  have 
fully  tried  it,  and  it  is  all  right.  I  have  used  all  the  different  dis- 
infectants in  my  kennels,  and  it  is  enough  to  say  I  will  now  use 
yours.     Please  ship  me  live  gallons." 


This  alone  should  be  enough  to  convince  you,  as  everyone  that  knows  Al.  G. 
Eberhart  has  explicit  confidence  in  what  he  says. 

We  have  other  testimonials  by  the  thousands,  which  space  will  not  allow 
us  to  print  here. 

STANDARD  DISINFECTANT  kills  fleas  and  cures   skin   diseases   on   dogs; 

can  be  used  around  the  stable,  and  is  the  best  friend  the  house-keeper  ever  had.

MY  ADVERTISERS 


Selected  from  the  leading  kennels  only — and 
quite  important  to  dog-interested  people  to 
know  where  a  dog  of  the  right  sort  can  be 
bought  at  a  right  price — from  the  right 
people.  Every  one  of  them  will  treat  you  square.  Most  of  them 
I  know  personally,  and  in  ordering,  you  can,  with  perfect 
safety,  send  the  money  with  the  order  (not  necessary  to  have 
the  dog  sent  on  approval),  for  they  will  ship  you  a  dog  ex- 
actly as  represented — that  will  please  and  satisfy  you.
