    "Asthma": "Asthma \u00e2\u20ac\u201d This is a common disease and a most distressing complaint \nits victims being mostly found among house pets and toy dogs that have \nbeen overfed with a too rich diet and lack of exercise as well Almast every \ntoy dog so improperly cared for and fed will develop asthma as they get \nalong in years The grossness of body induces and fosters it and often \ncauses as well a kind of scurvy mange the coat feeling harsh and dry with \na rough and dirty look The symptoms are distressing paroxysms of cough \ning with great difficulty in breathing which occur frequently The symp \ntoms exhibited are due to thickening of the mucus lining of the trachea and \nbronchial tubes which by lessening the calibre of the respiratory tract in \nterferes with the act of breathing which is attended by a loud wheezing \nnoise The blood is imperfectly aereated and the visible mucous mem \nbranes congested and dark in color Pugs and aged Spaniels seem pre \ndisposed to asthmatic troubles which while not usually fatal do not \nprove amenable to treatment \n\nAn important feature of the treatment is attention to the diet which \nshould be of a nonstimulating character First relieve the animal by giving \nthe following antispasmotic drops Compound spirits of sulphuric ether and \ntincture of opium equal parts which keep in a cool place and well corked \n\nThe dose for a 15lb to 30lb dog would be a small teaspoonful in a couple \nof tablespoonfuls of gruel or milk This however only relieves and does \nnot cure The dog must now have frequent doses of a brisk aperient and \na pill of the following prescription will be found very beneficial given every \nnight for a while \n\nPodophyllin 6 grains \n\nCompound extract of colocynth 30 grains \n\nPowdered rhubarb 4 8 grains \n\nExtract of henbane 36 grains \n\nMix and divide into twentyfour pills \n\nSmall breeds such as Pugs or Toy Poodles give half of one of these \npills \n\nA little warm broth after the pill will assist its action Feed rather \noftener than you do your well dogs but in small quantities Make dog take \nmore exercise every day which will cause him to more readily eat coarser \nfood The chance of a complete cure is not encouraging in a confirmed or \nchronic case but the regular use of the following pills will have a won \nderful effect in counteracting severe paroxysms \n\nPowdered ipecacuanha 6 grains \n\nPowdered opium 6 grains \n\nCompound squill pill 24 grains \n\nPowdered gum ammoniacum 24 grains \n\nPowdered licorice 24 grains \n\nPowdered rhubarb 12 grains \n\nMix and make into twentyfour pills \n\nThe dose for a 15lb to 40lb dog one pill morning and night Small \ner than 15lbs half a pill \n\nWhenever severe fits of coughing with difficulty of breathing occur \nif the antispasmodic drops mentioned in first article are not handy chloro \ndine may be given in the same way as the drops the dose being from \ntwenty to thirty drops Much relief can be given to asthmatical dogs by \nconfining them in a close box or kennel and filling it with the smoke of \nthorn apple This may be done twice a day but care should be taken \nwith such patients that they are not exposed to any sudden change of tem \nperature whether from heat or cold or the reverse \n\nOr in place of this during acute attacks when the breathing is very \nlabored relief may be obtained by inhalations of the fumes of burning \ntar resin or creosote \n\nAn asthmatic form of breathing is frequently found in connection with \ntumors involving the respiratory tract Such cases are incurable and it is \nthe most merciful procedure to put the animal to a painless death \n\nHarry W Lacy has the following to say as to asthma and I append it \nalso for the benfit it may do \n\n\nAsthma is a very common ailment among sporting dogs and is \nbrought on by repeated exposure followed by inattention If the simple \nduty of making a dog comfortable be attended to at the close of each days \nwork there need be little fear of anything like this ensuing It is not \nactually the exposure to the weather that causes a dog to have lung trou \nble because when a dog is out exposed he is constantly on the move and \nthe circulation keeps up so that it is not possible for him to contract a \nchill but the chill is contracted when the animal returns home and lies \ndown in a wet condition Then the blood ceases to circulate as rapidly \nas during exercise and the animal becomes shivery and a cold develops \nThis repeated a few times more or less will end in a cough and asthma \nwill ensue \n\nWhen once a dog has suffered from an attack of asthma there always \nremains with him a predisposition to a renewal of the trouble It is a most \ndistressing complaint and in the case of an animal like the dog which leads \nor should lead an active outdoor life it is almost impossible to effect a \npermanent cure Asthma differs from bronchitis in several ways It comes \non in paroxysms which gradually get worse and worse until finally the \nanimal is suffocated The treatment usually adopted consists in placing the \nanimal in a room or chamber where a kettle is constantly boiling so that \nthe atmosphere is kept continually moist \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as moist warmth does as much \ngood as anything to give relief in such cases As regards medicine some \nof the ordinary cough remedies may be tried the best thing perhaps being \nmixtifre of oxymel or squill and glycerine in equal parts to which a large \nparegoric elixir is added The dog should have this about three times a \nday \n\nAnother very good thing to do in connection with any treatment you use \nis cut up an onion small and fine anoint with a drop or two no more or \nit will blister of kerosene is excellent for asthma and bronchitis \n\nThis then put into a cotton cloth and tied around the dogs neck will \nafford relief in breathing The onion should be renewed by a fresh one \n\nHouse dogs suffer greatly from overindulgence errors in diet and lack \nof exercise which causes them to put on flesh rapidly These conditions \nproduce derangements of the heart lungs and circulatory system that fre \nquently result in a morbid condition of the system known as asthma In \nflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the bronchial tubes also \nproduces this disease so that colds and inhalations of noxious gases and \nvapors are common causes \n\nThe disease is easily recognized and there is no danger of confounding \nit with other affections of the chest It is not liable to prove fatal but \nseriously affects a dogs usefulness and will unquestionably shorten the \nanimals life \n\nSymptoms The patient shows great distress and difficulty in breathing \nparticularly after slight exertion and suffers more or less from suffocation \nRespirations are not increased in number but are labored and jerky and \nhave a wheezy croupy sound during expiration There is generally a \npeculiar cough The nostrils are dilated and the expression is anxious and \npitiful The coat of overfed dogs suffering from asthma is rough and \n\ndirty and dry and harsh to the touch The skin is often covered with a \nmangylooking scurf \n\nTreatment A radical cure of this disease is seldom effected but much \ncan be done to improve the animals condition During an acute attack \nof the disease prompt relief will be afforded by giving an emetic of ten \nto twenty grains of sulphate of zinc or thirty grains of ipecac The \nbowels should be kept open with cascara sagrada or olive oil \n\nMuch relief can be afforded to dogs suffering from the spasmodic \nform of the disease by confining them in a small rocm and burning on a \npan of coals one ounce of stramonium leaves and a drachm of nitrate of \npotassa \n\nThe following prescription can then be used with good results Potassa \niodidi two drams spirits ammonia arom one ounce tincture quassiae and \naquae of each two ounces Dose one teaspoonful three times a day \n\nGive the patient slow walking exercise restrict the diet prevent the \naccumulation of flesh as much as possible and aim to secure the best physi \ncal condition possible",

    "Bowels Inflammation of Enteritis Peritonitis": "Bowels Inflammation of Enteritis Peritonitis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d This is so ably \ntreated by Dalziel and by experience I know it to be good that I here re \nproduce his article in full The best plan however is to at once send for \na veterinarian providing you have one who understands or has made a \nspecialty of treating dogs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d anyhow get the best one in your locality and \ndont stop to think of what it will cost for you owe it to your dog to help \nhim out of his trouble if such a thing is possible \n\nThe severity and very dangerous charcter of this disease in the dog \nis such that perhaps the very best advice that can be given to the amateur \nwho finds his valuable dog attacked by it is send for a qualified veterinary \nsurgeon without delay The owner may however he possessed of sufficient \nselfconfidence as to wish to try his own skill in treating the disease or \nthe animal may not be considered of sufficient value to incure the expense \nof employing a professional man although there may be every desire to \nsave the animals life and if I can help in any such commendable endeavor \nwithout encouraging useless and ignorant experiments at the cost of torture \nto the dog I shall feel that I have been of some little service Whatever \ncourse is determined on whether home treatment or the calling in of pro \nfessional aid the decision should not be taken till the symptoms have been \ncarefully and minutely observed and the greatest attention must be paid \nto them else there is every fear of the amateur confounding it with and \ntreating it as colic a disease which although strongly resembling inflamma \ntion in some of its symptoms differs widely in others and requires totally \ndifferent treatment Colic if neglected or if wrongly treated may and \nfrequently does end in inflammation but it is in itself a distinct ailment \nand the same remark equally applies to constipation or obstruction of the \nbowels As inflammation of the bowels or enteritis is one of the most fatal \ndiseases to which the dog is liable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d frequently carrying him off very quick \nly\u00e2\u20ac\u201d no half measures will do for it but having ascertained clearly from \nthe prevailing symptoms that the disease is actually present remedial meas \nures must be adopted with promptitude and energy The main causes of the \ndisease are irregular or improper diet or it may be irritation caused by the \ndog having swallowed some hard indegestible substance exposure to cold \nand wet may produce it and it is sometimes the result of illusage such as \na kick \n\nInflamation of the bowels may be distinguished from colic in being \nmore gradual in its approach and is always ushered in by general feverish \nness the nose is hot and dry the eyes red and inflamed and the whole \ncountenance is expressive of great anxiety shivering fits occur the belly is \nhard and distended and in the surface hot to the touch the urine is gener \nally scanty and high colored As in colic when standing the back is arched \nthe feet are drawn in toward each other and the tail is tightly tucked be \n\ntween the legs or the clog may steal into a quiet corner stretch his legs \nout before and behind and crouch with his belly on the ground probably \nfinding temporary relief by bringing it in contact with the cold floor or \nground the dOg may at the same time be observed to frequently turn an \nanxious face toward his flanks \n\nAnother safe and pretty certain way of distinguishing between enteri \ntis and simple obstruction or colic is by pressing the hand along the belly \nin the latter disease especially colic the rubbing gives relief whereas in \ninflammation it evidently causes acute pain the cry of pain given by the \ndog in this disease is shorter and sharper than the rather prolonged howl \nin colic but to distinguish by this symptom would require finer discrimi \nnation than can be reasonably expected from the comparatively inexper \nienced for whom I presume to write I may here mention the fact that \nenteritis is very commonly a complication of that scorge of the kennel \ndistemper and this fact alone sufficiently shows the folly of trusting to \nany single medicine pill powder potion or any socalled specific whatever \nfor the cure of that disease The treatment proper in the disease under \nconsideration consists in getting the bowels relieved as speedily as possi \nble by the mildest means that can be used constipation being generally \npresent for this purpose the use of clysters every fifteen minutes as recom \nmended in obstruction of the bowels should be resorted to and the in \njections must be used gently and with as little fuss and annoyance to the \npatient as possible When the clysters begin to take effect the evacuation \nof the bowels should be assisted by a dose of castor oil From six to \ntwelve leeches according to the size and strength of the dog should be \napplied to the belly and after they have filled themselves the bleeding \nfrom the bites may be encouraged by bathing the whole surrounding parts \nfreely and continuously with warm water Many of the best writers on \ndogs recommend giving calomel and opium combined and it may appear \npresumptuous in me to offer a contrary opinion but experientia docet I \nhave given calomel to dogs in this disease and many others but I do not \nthink I ever once gave it without making the patient worse so I have \nlong discarded it in the firm belief that it is not a medicine at all suited \nto the dog and I am quite certain from my own experience and feel sure \nthe best veterinarians will bear me out that the abusive use of calomel \nand other forms of mercury given too often in immense and poisonous \ndoses to the dog by country farriers and others ignorant of its properties \nand who work by the rule of thumb is not infrequently the cause of \ninflammation of the bowels Instead of calomel I have in several cases \nused the following with excellent effect \n\nTake true James Powder 3 grains \n\nPowdered Opium 14 grain \n\nIn one ppwder Give every two hours till three are given large \nsized dogs require double that dose \n\nIf happily the dog gets over the attack with signs of returning health \ngreat weakness will be evident and this must be met by good nursing and \na generous but easily assimilated diet Beef tea thickened with bread \n\n\nrice etc will answer well The diet must be so varied as to keep the \nbowels open without the use of medicine \n\nWhen well on the road to health great progress will be accelerated by \ngiving Eberharts Tonic Pills for twenty to thirty days They contain no \ndope unlike many others make the dog eat and get him back to \nhealth flesh and spirits \n\nTo allay the pain give 5 gr to 10 gr of chloral with 5 to 30 drops \nof tincture of opium also apply hot flannels to the abdomen \n\nThe following treatise on this trouble was written especially for this \nbook by Dent and I consider it also very valuable \n\nAn affection of the small intestines This

to be epidemic many cases occurring in the \nsame neighborhood at the same time it has not been shown to be contagious \nand although it is not a fatal disease it is a very troublesome one \n\nThe symptoms appear without warning and apparently without cause \nThe first thing generally observed is a considerable increase in the flow \nof saliva which dribbles from the mouth The breath is foetid and on \nexamination the tongue will be found considerably swollen while if the \ndisease has lasted any time there will be observed large livid vesicles which \nrupture leaving ulcers these ultimately assume a gangrenous form and \ndischarge foetid matter tinged with blood \n\nThe above description of Blain malignant sore mouth I quote from \nDalziel \n\nI have never had a case of this trouble which is not often found in \ndogs The following was written on this trouble by Dr C L Thulichum \nfor Forest and Stream and it is through their courtesy that I publish it \n\nCauses of this trouble are conjectural the disease is most prevalent \nin the spring and summer and more frequently found in the southern than \nin the northern latitudes I do not know of any authority who assigns any \nparticular cause for this trouble and although I can not say with any \ncertainty myself I have however noted the following conditions \nand they may be supposable causes but I do not wish to go on record \nas asserting that they are the actual causes as they are simply deductions \nof my own \n\nI was located in the South in practice some years ago when I first \nsaw a case of this trouble in the dog At that time I had on my hands \nseveral cases of anthrax or Texas fever in cattle I noted that whenever \nI found a case of this trouble in the dog I could also by inquiry find that \nin the neighborhood some one had not long before lost a cow from the cow \ndisease as they called it As the dogs were allowed in that section to \nrun at large and as a dog is when at large more or less of a scavenger I \nconcluded that either the dog affected had found the carcass of the cow \nthat had died and been buried and dug himself up a meal from her or \nthat following that very desirable habit that most dogs are possessed of \nrolling in carrion he had taken a roll in this filth and then in licking him \nself afterward had thus infected his mouth with the disease This as \nsumption may be entirely wrong but I give it for what it is worth and it \nis the most common sense cause that I can give for the disease in the section \nin which I met it The English authorities do not assign any cause simply \nsaying that the attack often begins without any apparent or previous illness \nwhich is so the attack is apparently sudden your dog seems well today \nand tomorrow has a very sore mouth \n\nSymptoms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Dog may be a little listless for a day or two which may \nnot be noticed Next and noticeable symptom is that he wants to drink a \n\n\ngreat deal of water and drools saliva from the corners of the mouth \ntongue is enlarged and thickened You look into the mouth and find it \ncovered on its sides and under surface with large vesicles of a red or livid \ncolor which may end in irregular and even gangrenous ulcers the breath \nis extremely offensive and discharge of salvia very great dog will not eat \nand apparently can not swallow but this is a mistake \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he can but wont \nowing to the great soreness of the mouth If the disease is not checked \nnow it passes on to the bowels and the dog dies with severe bloody dis \ncharges \n\nTreatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d There is only one that I have ever found necessary and if \nyou get at the dog promptly before the bowel trouble commences I believe \nyou will affect a cure in every case at least I have \n\nGet an ounce of the tincture of sanquinaria canadensis at your drug \ngists and a camels hair throat pencil or swab on wire Paint the inside of \nthe mouth and tongue where affected with this morning and night and \ngive a tablet of bichloride of mercury onehundredth of a grain three \ntimes a day internally Feed nothing but milk for several days after \ncure is effected Buttermilk is one of the finest adjuncts to a cure You \nwatch the dog closely and dont give him too much water not until he \nsuffers from the lack of it but so that he will be thirsty enough to drink the \nbuttermilk when you hand it to him Have it as cold as possible and give \nhim a soup plate full three times a day one day sweet milk the next but \ntermilk After he is well feed him for some time boiled rice and milk and \nbuttermilk and bring him gradually on to his regular feed \n\nThe above treatment I have found to put the mouth in such shape \nthat the dog will take nourishment after the first twentyfour hours and \nafter that he will steadily improve and four or five days sees the mouth \nentirely healed except that it is still tender to solid food To a dog the \nsize of a setter or hound you can give as high as a fiftieth of a grain at a \ndose of the bichloride of mercury to pups and smaller breeds onehun \ndredth of a grain is enough and in fact I confine myself to this dose with \nall sized dogs under St Bernards or mastiffs as it is quite as effective in \nthe smaller dose as in the larger",

\nvery liable to end in inflammation of the bowels \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a most dangerous dis \nease which in some of its features though happily not its dangerous ones \ncolic resembles One very important point of distinction is that whereas \ninflammation comes on gradually and feverishness with hot dry nose etc \nalways exist as premonitory symptoms colic comes on suddenly and a dog \neating well and seeming in perfect health is seized with spasm of the \ncoat of the bowels causing such pain that he gives voice to a low moan \nwhich is afterward changed to a prolonged howl as the paroxysms of pain \nincrease in frequency and severity In colic too the nose and mouth are \ncool and there is no offensive breath As in inflammation the attitude \nis peculiar and unmistakable the back ebing arched the feet drawn in \ntoward each other and the tail tightly tucked between his legs in colic \nthe belly is sometimes distended considerably with gas and is then known \nas flatulent colic It is a disease of frequent occurrence in dogs and the \nexciting causes are various exposure to wet and cold getting dogs espe \ncially house dogs to swin in cold inclement weather are common causes \nthe presence of worms in the intestines also produces colic But the most \ncommon cause is undoubtedly the giving of improper food sugar and \n\n\nother sweet things are likely to produce it puppies just after weaning \nare very liable to it especially if they have small lumps of meat or other \nsolid food thrown to them which they can not well chew but greedily \nbolt or having a portion of one meal left in the dish till the next meal \nis added is very likely to produce it because the stale portion undergoes \nfermentation that is becames sour and the fermentation is carried on in \nthe stomach Colic is sure to yield to prompt and proper measures and \nthe treatment is simple and safe As soon as observed give the sufferer \na dose of antispasmodic drops Compound spirits of

\nThere is not much if any pain in chorea and I had a pug bitch three \nyears old that had a chronic case of it but yet she bred and raised a \nhealthy litter of pups This was an exception however as being a ner \nvous trouble it is transmitable and I would not advise using either a \nbitch or a dog for breeding purposes that was so afflicted It is of course \nunpleasant to see a dog constantly twitching or jerking but so long as they \ndo not suffer I think it my duty to let them live \n\nThis most distressing complaint arises from some derangement of \nthe nervous system and generally exists as a sequence of distemper when \nIt is known among kennel men as the twitch Chorea or St Vitus dance \nmay however arise from other causes producing a disturbing effect on the \nnervous system such as a severe Injury or blow on the head the irrita \ntion caused by worms or longcontinued Impaired digestion By far the \nmost common cause however is distemper the brain receiving some in \njury in that variety of the disease known as Head Distemper The symp \ntom Indicating chorea is a peculiar Involuntary convulsive twitching of \nthe muscles These spasmodic movements or jerklngs may be either par \ntial or general but usually partial One or both hind legs are affected \nor the twitching extends to the muscles of the fore legs neck and shoul \nders in which case the head is bobbed up and down in a silly helpless \nmanner Sometimes the eyelids and muscles of the face are affected but \nWhatever part of the body is attacked the peculiar twitching or jerking \nIs always unmistakable When the hind quarters are the seat of the \ndisease the dog will sometimes suddenly drop one of the limbs from the \nhip joint apparently from sudden loss of power or command over the \nguiding muscles The weakness is strongly shown when the dog attempts \nto jump onto a chair or the lap which he fails to do and generally falls \non hte side all in a heap There are very few dogs severely afflicted with \n\n\nr \u00e2 \n\nchorea that ever get completely cured When the attack is but slight the \ndog may live for years and prove a useful animal as except in severe \ncases it does not seem to greatly impair the general health The con \nstant twitching is however so annoying a sight to most people that few \nwould care to keep a dog thus afflicted Although dogs carefully and \nproperly treated in distemper are less likely to suffer from this disease \nyet it will occasionally occur in the best managed kennels and so I must \nproceed to consider its treatment The first thing to be done is to attend \nto the general health and especially to see that the bowels are in a properly \nregulated state and it is better if their action requires correction to \nendeavor to accomplish that object by a careful regulation of diet rather \nthan by a resort to physic indeed all through chorea the food must be \nof a nature easily digested and given with regularity if any course of \nmedicinal treatment is to be successful The remedies recommended in \nchorea are arsenic sulphate of zinc nitrate of silver and nux vomica and \nits preparations Arsenic I do not recommend but either of the following \nmay be tried and it is sometimes found that using them alternately has \na more beneficial effect than a perseverance with one remedy only Pills \nmay be made thus \n\nSulphate of Zinc Pills \n\nSulphate of zinc 2 4 grains \n\nExtract of gentian 18 grains \n\nPowdered gum acacia 18 grains \n\nMake into twelve pills Dose for a dog 30lb to 50lb weight one \npill

of course they ae not infallible As the \ningredients require very great accuracy in weighing and very careful \nmixing this must be left to a properly qualified dispensing chemist and \nthe box containing the pills should be kept strictly in the masters pos \nsession for fear of accident \n\nStrychnine 1 grain \n\nQuinine 18 grains \n\nExtract of belladonna 6 grains \n\nExtract of gentian 1

pill St Bernards one and onehalf pills as a dose \n\nIt is necessary in chorea to continue the use of these remedies for a \nconsiderable time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at least a month or two months in most cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to \nproduce any satisfactory result or even to give them a fair trial and as \nbefore said the dog must be carefully fed well lodged and properly exer \ncised when he has sufficient power to use his limps and in the case of dogs \nreared in towns a change to the country for some weeks would be beneficial \nGalvanism has been recommended for chorea I have not seen it tried but \nshould think it well worth a trial \n\nHere are two different cases of chorea prescribed for by the American \nField \n\nAbout two months since I bred a young pug bitch and shortly after \nward I noticed a nervous affection in her face just about as regular as \na clock would tick the lower jaw would drop and raise again and for a while \nher tongue would hang out at one side as if partially paralyzed What is \nthe probable cause and what treatment should she have She did not \nwhelp and this was her first mating Ans \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Chorea give two drops of \nFowlers Solution of Arsenic three times daily for six consecutive days then \nincrease the dose one drop daily until fifteen drops are given at each and \nevery dose continue this for one week then decrease in the same raitio \n\nPlease prescribe for my English setter bitch that has had for the \nlast two months a severe jerking in her fore legs seeming to be worse \nin damp weather otherwise she is apparently in good health The bitch \nhad the distemper about two or three months ago Ans \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Chorea For \nten consecutive days give ten grains of iodide of potash three times daily \nthen give six drops of Fowlers Solution three times daily for seven con \nsecutive days and on the eighth day increase the dose one drop daily \nuntil thirty drops are given at each and every dose continue this for \nfourteen days then decrease in the same raitio The electric battery has \nproved of great benefit in many cases \n\nThe two above cases of chorea in a pug and an English setter gives \n\nyou the old and wellknown Fowlers Solution of Arsenic treatment and \n\nprbper sized doses if you wish to try it This is the oldtime remedy and \n\nhas cured Chorea when directions were carefully followed \n\n\u00e2 \u00e2\u20ac \n\nThe following article on Chorea was written especially for this book \nby Dent \n\nChorea is the most distressing nervous complaint dog owners are \nfamiliar with It is due to an involuntary nervous discharge of the motor \ncells controlling certain muscles The essential pathology of these more \nor less constant muscular twitchings has baffled all scientific investigation \nand careful microscopic autopsies extending from the nerve terminus in a \nmuscle back to the cord and brain have failed to reveal a lesion that can \nbe considered a cause \n\nThe most satisfactory theory is that the brain cells controlling a \ncertain muscle or set of muscles are so weakened by the poison of distemper \nor some other cause as to cause them to send out muscular impulses with \nout natural mental impulse or will power \n\nThere is a form of chorea clue to a disturbed nervous system induced \nby blows or injuries to the or the presence of intestinal parasites which \nhave deranged the digestive organs This form of chorea is generally \ncurable The form which follows distemper is not so amenable to treat \nment \n\nThe symptoms are so prominent and characteristic that there is no \nmistaking the disease and the peculiar involuntary twitching of the muscles \nonce seen is never forgotten Then entire body may be affected generally \nit is only one set of muscles those of the foreleg or of the neck and shoul \nders in which case the head bobs up and down in a most helpless manner \nWhere the hindlegs are affected the dog will suddenly drop one of the limbs \nfrom the hip downward as if there was an entire loss of strength and \npower This is particularly noticeable if it attempts to jump on a chair \nor table for after one or two attempts it falls on its side or in a heap \ncompletely helpless \n\nThe top of the head is often affected and twitches and throbs in a \nmost peculiar manner and the jerking is commonly observable about the \nmuscles of the eyelids lips and face In severe cases of chorea the gen \neral health is affected and the animal shows signs of suffering probably \ndue to anxiety and appreciation of its helpfulness In mild cases it does \nnot affect the animals general health and some field dogs have it all \ntheir lives without affecting their usefulness The owner however \nis annoyed by the constant muscular movements and is always anxious to \neffect a cure Some cases are quiet during sleep others are worse \n\nTreatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Although the disease occurs in the best regulated ken \nnels despite the most careful treatment of distemper it does not alter the \nfact that dogs properly treated for distemper and worms and well housed \nand fed are less liable to the disease than those which are neglected \n\nThe first thing to do is to look after the animals general health \nSee that the bowels act promptly and this is accomplished best by dieting \nand the feeding of foods possessing laxative properties and not by resorting \nto physics If there is the slightest suspicion of worms treat for them \nas they torment the nervous system beyond all measure and are the cause \nof many attacks \n\nFeed regularly and carefully and if there is a tendency to constipa \ntion use well boiled oatmeal Mutton broths with stale bread beef well \nboiled or raw lean beef chopped fine From two to five grains of pepsin \nand onehalf grain of diastase can be given after each meal to assist the \nstomach in the process of digestion If there is much debility and weak \nness give emulson of cod liver oil in doses of from one teaspoonful to \nthree tablespoonfuls three or four times a day \n\nThe drugs principally used are mix vomica or strychnine and arsenic \nSome practitioners use a dose of nux vomica in the morning and arsenic at \nnight As both of these drugs are poisonous they must be used with care \nThe dose of nux vomica is from two to twelve drops of the tincture twice \na day It is a valuable vegetable bitter and an aid to digestion as well \nas a nerve stimulant Any stiffness of the muscles or tendency to spasms \nis an indication for its immediate discontinuance \n\nFowlers Solution of Arsenic is the most convenient form The dose \n\n\n46 DISEASE3 \n\nis from one to thirty drops Give a drop at first increasing it one drop \na day up to the larger dose then gradually decreasing and discontinue \nfor a time and whenever there is any constitutional symptoms of its ef \nfects such as reddened or fullness under the eye nausea whitish tongue \netc \n\nThe following pills are highly recommended by many who have used \n\u00e2\u20acthem As some of the ingredients are poisonous they should be prepar \ned by a qualified druggist or pharmacy graduate Strychnine one grain \nextract of belladonna six grains extract of gentian one dram gipsin three \ndrams Mix carefully and divide into fortyeight pills one of which is \nto be given night and morning in the patients food This dose is for a \ndog weighing from thirty to fifty pounds \n\nThe medicines heretofore mentioned are in their action purely alter \native and nerve stimulating in connection with them may be mentioed \nthe use of the electrical current from a surgeons battery Obstinate and \napparently incurable cases sometimes show a decided improvement and \nradical cures are effected in response to a gentle stimulating current of \nelectricity One electrode should be applied to the neck directly over the \nspinal cord the other to the extremity of the affected leg and the electrical \nstimulation continued for from five to thirty minutes twice a day The \nbeneficial effects from a careful massage of the leg and a manipulation of \nthe muscles cannot be overestimated Besides breaking down adhesions \nor agglutinations of the muscle fibers it increases the supply of blood to \nthe part and promotes its nutrition and has a most beneficial reflex action \non the entire nervous system",
    "Cramp": "Cramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201d This term is often indiscriminately applied by sportsmen \nto spasm from whatever cause but cramp of the limbs from exposure to \ncold and wet often occurs and it will quickly yield to brisk rubbing and \nwarmth If nothing else is handy rub with a little spirit and water or a \nrough dry cloth Dogs used in hunting or retrieving from water are very \nliable to it the hindquarters being most frequently affected and in such \ncases a good brisk liniment such as the following should be carried in the \nboat",

    "Choking": "Choking \u00e2\u20ac\u201d This accident is not uncommon with greedy animals that \nbolt their food a bone a piece of gristly meat or other hard substance \nis bolted and sticks fast in its passage to the stomach I always adopt \n\nthe plan of reserving bones until after the clogs have fed for if given with \nthe other food they are at once picked out and the smaller ones are \nwhen the dog is hungry apt to be swallowed unmasticated and produce \nchoking \n\nTreatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Frequently by manipulating the throat outside with the \nfingers the obstruction can be worked down the gullet or if it can be felt \nin the upper part of the throat it may be removed by the throat forceps \nwhich most veterinary surgeons keep by them Hill recommends when the \nsubstance is too low for extraction and manipulating with the fingers \nexternally fails to endeavor gently to force it down with a piece of bent \nwhalebone having a piece of sponge tied to the end of it and dipped in \noil In using this extra care must be taken that the sponge is so firmly \nattached to the whalebone that it cannot slip off for if swallowed it might \neffectually block up one of the smaller intestines therefore cut nitches \nin the whalebone into which tie the piece of sponge As soreness if not \nactual laceration is almost sure to be caused the dog should for some \ndays after be confined to soft food \n\nThe following on choking I found The subject is so ably treated \nthat I publish it also \n\nThis is of very frequent occurrence with dogs as usually they are \nvoracious feeders careless of consequences and the fact that they use \ntheir mouths much as we do our hands in grasping and conveying various \nobjects makes them particularly liable to swallow foreign substances that \nmay become lodged in the gullet The commonest objects on which dogs \nchoke are bones that they have been feeding upon If the bone lodges \nin the back of the throat it may set up such a violent coughing and \nretching as to asphyxiate the subject The back of the throat however is \nnot the usual lodging place for as a rule the bone or other object passes \nthat point where the gullet is comparatively large and lodges over the \nheart where it is smaller Locating at this point causes the greatest \ndistress The dog keeps gulping as if trying to swallow and from time \nto time is seized with a period of retching In a day or two the extreme \ndistress passes and the patient drinks water and milk or other liquids \nfreely and can also swallow raw eggs but if solid food is taken directly \nit reaches the obstruction it lodges Young dogs and those which are \nplayful sometimes swallow needles and pins These usually become \nimbedded in the back of the tongue and can be removed from that position \nbut sometimes they reach the gullet and pass through into the tissues \nforming an abscess their usual location being just behind the angle of \nthe jaw Removing needles and pins from the back of the tongue is done \nmost easily with a pair of forceps although it sometimes can be done with \nthe finger The principal thing is to be careful not to break the object \nThe symptoms in these cases are usually very severe so that prompt action \nis necessary In those cases where a bone has pased far down the gullet \nand lodged over the heart it is sometimes sufficient to feed the dog a few \npieces of meat which will force the obstruction on If this is not success \nful a probang must be uesd to force the obstruction down into the stom \nach but this should be attempted only by a skillful veterinarian or a \nphysician as it may be necessary to use considerable force and there is \n\n\n48 jdanger of rupturing the gullet which is fatal If the obstruction cannot \nbe removed by the probang then the only thing remaining is to feed \nthe patient on liquid food until such time as the sharp points of the bone \nbecome dissolved and rounded off so that it will be easily pushed along \nby the probang \n\nCHLOROFORMING DOGS FOR AN OPERATION \n\nIf it is really necessary to do this then have a careful anethetist who \nunderstands his subject do the work A quarter of an hour is long enough \nfor a dog to be kept under the influence and should be ample time for any \noperation Chloroform is dangerous at best with any dogs and with some \nbreeds Chow Chows for instance it is sure to mean a dead dog Anyone \nwho has had experience in the destruction of dogs with chloroform knows \nhow quickly they succumb to it Ether is a safer anesthetic which can \nbe used with as much success and far less risk \n\nIf an anesthetic has to be given ask the operating surgeon to use \nether The bet way to give an anesthetic put on a wire cage muzzle \nhaving first secured dog so he cannot struggle Around the muzzle an \nordinary piece of surgeons list can be placed and on this the anesthetic \n\nFor many minor operations liquid cocaine can be used instead the \ndog strapped down and his owner also hold and control his dog I have \ndone this without the strapping even talked to the dog he understood me \nand stood the pain This was the removal of a cyst on a Pug dog behind \nhis ear the size of a lemon Cocaine was used",

\nblood The loss of strength is very rapid and the dog must be supported \nby drenching with beef tea and a little port wine in it the medicine and \ngeneral treatment being the same as in diarrhea In one case of this kind \nin a retriever I gave two doses of twenty drops of chlorodyne with very \ngood effect The discharges in dysentery are immediately caused by in \nflammation of the mucous

\nsuccess Take sima ruba bark two ounces and put it in a quart of water \nboil this down to a pint then strain and boil this down to half a pint \nBe careful to not burn The dose for a dog the size of a pointer would \nbe a teaspoonful three times a day Large dogs like a St Bernard two \nteaspoonfuls at a dose while very small toy dogs like a toy terrier should \nhave half a teaspoonful at a time \n\nThe following prescription was furnished me by Mr J A Rogers of \nIronton Ohio after trying it on his pointer that had suffered with chronic \ndysentery for over a month till the dog was a skeleton and could hardly \nstand up This dog had been treated for worms at first supposed to be \nthe cause of the trouble and several wellknown remedies tried but no \nworms and no stoppage of the

\nacute form there is much looseness of the bowels frequently accompanied \nor preceded by copious vomiting of acrid offensive matter the evacua \ntions are loose watery and offensive If not checked it soon produces \nexcessive weakness and especially in puppies is the cause of great mor \ntality In the chronic state the disease is slower in its progress and longer \nin its duration It may be set up by a diseased liver and excess of bile or \nit may be the result of inflammation of the bowels A by no means un \ncommon cause is the abuse of calomel and other mercurials these being \nspecifics

matter and often frothy \nand covered with small air bubbles When worms appear to be the cause \nmeans should be taken to expel them as directed later on Exhalations \nfrom accumulations of filth and

advantage to give a mild purge to remove the irritating cause \nCastor oil is very suitable and if there is evidence of much pain attend \ning the disease a dose of laudanum from 20 to 30 drops may be

limbs champing of the jaws and emission of froth \nfrom the mouth the tongue may get cut by the involuntary action of the \njaw and being tinged with blood adds to the fears of those ignorant of \nthe disease and from this unfounded alarm the dog may be supposed to \nbe mad and the poor fellow killed See treatment under head of \nEpileptic Fits \n\nEye Diseases of the Dogs are subject to all eye troubles that hu \nmans are and perhaps more so Eye troubles I have had great success \nin treating and when I see them appear in a dog I am not at all worried \nThey must be cared for at once however Accidents to the eye are not \nuncommon as from scratches by a cat injuries from a blow or in fighting \nIn such cases the first thing to do is to bathe it with warm water for \nfrom fifteen to thirty minutes this to reduce the swelling and inflamma \ntion which follows If the injury is great a veterinarian had best be called \n\nin but otherwise Eberharts Eye Lotion No 1 or No 2 can be used

\n\nNow as to the above this is the one I had in First Edition of this \nbook only there I had in it 38 grains of cocaine instead of 10 grains as \nin this Under the old formula I used it for years and with it I saved \nthe sight of hundreds of dogs \n\nA lady living near New York had a Blenheim spaniel that was nearly \nblind from diseased eyes She took it to a celebrated occulist in New York \nwho pronounced it a hopeless case telling her that the dog would go totally \nblind and very soon She wrote me and I sent her this prescription and \nin a couple of weeks her dogs eyes were as sound and well as any dogs \neyes ever were The dogs eyes were apparently nearly dropping out of its \nhead and looked as if you could knock them off with your finger when \nshe took him to this eye doctor When she after the cure showed the dog \nto the doctor he could hardly believe it was the same dog and said Well \nits simply wonderful \n\nNow here is \n\nEberharts Eye Lotion No 2 \n\nAcid boracic 10 grains \n\nCocaine 9 grains \n\nSulphate of zinc 2 grains \n\nAqua camphor 1 tablespoonful \n\nAqua rosa 1 tablespoonful \n\nDrop in eye a few drops two or three times daily \n\nI now consider No 2 a better one than No 1 for most all eye \ntroubles and have used it for several years instead of No 1 It can \nnever do any harm but always benefit This one due to the camphor \nwater in it will not keep well for over a few weeks or so and therefore \nshould this be remembered and not used when having stood too long \nEither should be always tightly corked and a glass stoppered bottle is \nmuch the best Only get half the prescription filled at a time probably \nenough for the case and saves extra expense If any trouble in getting it \nI can sent it by mail for sixty cents \n\nAVhenever I find any trouble in any of my dogs eyes I at once use the \nNo 2 even in case of a slight cold caught and which had settled into the \neye as shown by inflammation mattery or watery discharge or even only \nan apparent weakness or blinking when dog was exposed to a strong light \nIn such cases bathing the eyes first with a Boracic Acid solution how \n\n\nto make is given under that heading see index just a couple drops twice \na day is required \n\nPugs toy spaniels and all dogs with prominent or pop eyes as \nthey are termed are greatly troubled with their eyes and here is where \nI found out the merits of my own eye remedies \n\nYou may discover some morning the eye of your dog covered with \na blue film this is so common in pop eyed dogs that I named it blue eye \nfor short Very rapidly this eye the ball will enlarge and if not promptly \ntreated will assume proportions that are apparently startling and in a \nfew days if not taken care of the ball of the eye would bulge out so much \nthat it would seem as if it would drop out of its head Dont be alarmed \nfor my lotion No 2 will take care of this will cure the eye which \nin due time will be sound as ever the same as it was before this trouble \nappeared and the sight saved as perfect as ever No 2 will never fail to \ncure ulceration and perforation of the ball of the eye if used in time In \nsome cases a white spot or speck will remain but the sight is all right \nand to remove this spot use the following \n\nEye Salve \n\nVaseline 1 ounce \n\nYellow oxide of mercury 2 grains \n\nMix use daily putting inside the eye a portion about the size of a pea \nthen closing the eye rub it gently This prescription should be \nthoroughly and carefully mixed by your druggist This is very im \nportant \n\nIn other cases the No 2 has done all the curing and there was no \nwhite spot left Due to the present stringent laws in many states as to \nnarcotics it will be necessary to have your doctor write this prescription \nbecause of the cocaine in it Where I discovered this No 2 was in \nthe case of a Pug dog I had bought that when I received her from the \nexpress company had gotten this on her long trip and I at once took her \nto my own eye doctor Dr Robert C Heflebower now one of the greatest \nif not the greatest eye specialist in the world today My bill with him \nfor this dog was eighteen dollars and now with No 2 it can be cured \nfor less than a dollar I consider this No 2 worth more than twenty \ntimes the cost of a copy of this book \n\nDogs are subject to affections of the eye in more or less degree ac \ncording to their breed and uses Hunting dogs are naturally owing to the \nnature of their work more subject than other dogs to receive injuries \nfrom thorns dust and dirt and other foreign matter This will be followed \nby more or less inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the eye \nlids which is attended by a watery discharge at first and assuming a more \npurulent condition as the trouble increases \n\nIt is well known that a small particle of grit may remain under an \neyelid in spite of fomentations and should the eye be examined without \ndiscovery of the source of trouble very often an application of pure olive \noil with a camels hair brush to the underpart of the eyelid Avill oftenG5 \n\nsucceed in carrying off the irritant which may be too small to discern \nThis however is usually to be considered merely a preliminary step and \nmy Eye Lotion No 2 should be then used to remove the inflammation thus \ncaused If your dog brings about a swollen or inflamed condition of the \neyelids through a chance scratch of the claws in rubbing their face use \nmy Eye Lotion No 2 after having first bathed the parts with warm water \nDifferent form of indigestion may be associated with irritation of the \nmucous membranes throughout and the eyes will suffer in common with \nthe other parts Rheumatism is also one of the maladies which are at \ntended with inflammation more or less pronounced of the eyes with the \neyeball itself and the lids participating in the disorder It must therefore \nbe obvious that the common expression a discharge from theeyes may \nrefer to a variety of morbid conditions which are not to be counteracted \nby an application of a lotion to the eye Perhaps a safe guide for the \ntyro in medicine may be found in the duration of the discharge In any \ncase of simple irritation from the presence of dirt or grit it may be fairly ex \npected that the symptoms will cease very quickly upon the application of \nsimple remedies that is to say after it has been clearly ascertained that \nthere is no offending body adherent to the underneath part of the eyelid \nThe continuance of the discharge week after week or even month after \nmonth may certainly be taken to mean that something more than ordinary \nirritation of a simple kind is present and under such circumstances the \nchances are that the common eye water for example three or four grains of \nboracic acid in an ounce of rose water for example three or four grains of \npossibly do some harm by checking the discharge which is really critical \nin its character The proper course in such cases would be to consult an \nexpert in diseases of the dog who will most probably be able to find some \nconstitutional cause to account for what has been looked upon as a local \ndisorder",

    "Ear Canker Internal": "Ear Canker Internal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d There are two forms of this disease internal \nand external the latter generally the result of the former I will first \nprescribe for internal Canker is a term generally applied to different \nobstinate corroding or heating humors horses having it in the feet \nsheep having foot rot but unless the irritation is caused in the foot \nof the dog sometimes by hard running on rough ground causing canker \n\nous sores and which should be treated the same as internal ear canker \nit is not found in dogs except in the ear \n\nCauses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d First of all and most common is some injury such as blows \non the ear or pulling the ears a habit some people have as a method of \ncorrection and one that is most pernicious Others of which probably \nthe principal one is getting the cars full of water in diving swimming or \nretrieving from water followed by lack of exercise too rich food dirty \ndamp kennel to sleep in and excess of fat as it is often found in fat lazy \ndogs \n\nCanker may be the result of exposure to cold overfeeding the pres \nence of insects foreign bodies or an accumulation of wax in the ear are \nalso fertile causes while the most common is the washing of dogs with \ncoarse alkaline soaps which are totally unfit for the sensitive skin of the \ndog The soap during the washing gains access to the ear setting up \ndangerous inflammation \n\nHugh Dalziel says Is there not another and frequent cause \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whether \nthose sportsmen do not often produce it who instead of correcting \ntheir dogs by the legitimate means of the voice and the whip resort \nto another method much to be condemned Lugging a dog is as cruel \nas kicking him neither is a fit mode of punishment and the former \nvery likely to produce canker \n\nEar canker is one of the nuisances of dog keeping and when neg \nlected is a most obstinate complaint The experienced dogman is always \non the alert but the novice may not detect the trouble until the ear \ndischarges an acrid secretion The careful kennelman will examine his \ndogs ears as a part of the daily grooming \n\nInternal Canker is an inflammation of the lining membrane of the \npassage to the ear which if neglected turns into ulceration and suppuration \nand when of long standing a blackish offensive discharge takes place \naccumulating in the air passage and the interior of the ear will be found \nred and inflamed \n\nWhen you notice the following symptoms begin at once to treat him \nfor it the sooner the better to save your dog pain and yourself trouble \n\nThe dog thus suffering will be observed frequently scratching his ear \nwith his paw holding his head on one side giving it a violent shake as \nthough to empty something out the pain and irritation causing him to \nthus shake his head whereby the flaps of they ear get bruised ulcerations \nform the tips become sore the inflammation in the interior lining mem \nbrane extends to the outside and from the shaking and scratching is formed \nexternal canker \n\nWhen a dog shakes his head scratches his ear with his paw and \nholds his head to one side it is high time to investigate and apply remedies \n\nThe acrid discharges if not cleared away will lead to irritation of \nthe flap of the ear the flap swells and looks angry often breaking out in \nsores at the tips and edges This is external canker The peculiarly of \nfensive odor of the ear passage is a sure sign of internal canker \n\nTreatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Wash out the ear with warm water and soapsuds use \neither Castile or Eberharts Dog Soap rinse with clean warm water and \n\n\nperoxyde of hydrogen one part of peroxyde to four parts of water by \nmeasure \n\nDry out the ear with absorbent cotton swabs made by rolling cotton \nloosely on a skewer or clean piece of stick Dry thoroughly \n\nThe ear is now ready for treatment and here is my remedy which has \nnever failed to cure the most obstinate cases even of long standing and \nI give this as having proved to be an infallible cure \n\nI cured a valuable poodle that had a bad case in both ears for a \nyear three veterinarians having treated the dog and failed to cure him \nThe dog was then shipped to my kennels and I sent him back in a few \nweeks entirely cured This was the worst case I ever saw or handled \nand I cured him with the prescription herewith given \n\nIodine 16 grains \n\nIodide of potassium 32 grains \n\nMix these two first in a tablespoonful of water and then add one pint \nof pure cider vinegar Keep in bottle corked up \n\nAfter ear has been cleaned out and dried as directed take your dog \nand lay his head on your knee and pour in or inject with a rubber syringe \nif he will hold still about a tablespoonful of the remedy into the ear and \ngently work or knead it in for a few minutes Do this once a day only \nuntil the ear gets better and then every other day is often enough You \ncan look for a cure of ordinary cases in a week or less if treatment was \nbegun promptly at first signs neglected cases requiring more time \n\nHere are several other good remedies \n\nCreolin 30 grains \n\nSulphate of zinc 16 grains \n\nWater 8 ounces \n\nThis one should be injected twice daily after cleansing the ear same \nas or the first remedy given \n\nThis one is to be used three times a day Cleanse the ear with in \njections of equal parts of peroxyde of hydrogen and water three timefe a \nday then injeet two teaspoonfuls of the following Sulphate of zinc one \ndram sugar of lead two drams glycerine two ounces water six ounces \n\nAnd this one to be used twice a day Sulphate of zinc ten grains \nacetate of lead thirty grains credlin onehalf ounce glycerine three ounces \nwater to make eight ounces inject a tablespoonful into the ear twice a \nday \n\nThe discharge from the ear will cause sores on the inside of flap so \nwhen injecting the medicine wash these sores with the same My iodine \nprescription is especially good for these sore spots Injecting with rubber \nsyringe is always best if your dog will hold quiet and not resist treatment \nand in

something new to use internally for \nthe blood in connection with my skin remedy externally A pure white \nsulphur only obtainable of a homeopathic druggist and is called \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Sulphur \n12X I succeeded in curing up several cases of chronic eczema that I had \nfailed with before One was a Chow Chow a longcoated dog that was \nalmost bare of hair using the skin remedy once a day well rubbed in with \nthe hands and giving him morning and night mixed in his food as it is \ntasteless as much as would hold on a silver dime Sometimes I gave it \ndry by opening mouth and dropping it well back on his tongue mornings \nwhen his breakfast was dry Spratts dog cakes This dogs coat came out \nfull this part mostly due to my skin remedy which is a hair grower If \nno homeopathic druggist in your town your druggist can order it for you \nor you can get it from me I consider this valuable treatment for eczema \nas so far it has not failed to cure \n\nIf your dog has skin trouble find out whether it is eczema or one \nof the several kinds of mange see Mange also \n\nThe following on eczema written by Dr F Holmes Brown is an able \narticle on this subject \n\nEczema in the dog manifests many of the same signs and symptoms \nof the same disease found in man No disease in the whole range of skin \ndiseases is so difficult to treat properly In eczema in the dog it is especially \nimportant that one first of all find out what is causing the disease then \nseek to remove it In that way only can we hope for success \n\nEczema is an acute or chronic catarrhal inflammatory disease of the \nskin In the dog it manifests itself in two separate and distinct forms first \nthe blotch or nervous or neurotic form and second the red mange or irri \ntative form The lesions in this disease vary according to the acting cause \nthe seat of the disease and the care given the dog The blotch or neurotic \nform attaclfs the skin on the head and along the back This form is similar \nto the milk crust found in children and li due to much the same causes \nThe red mange is that form in which the skin is generally red but it is \nmore visible under the legs on the back and abdomen \n\nThe usual form of eruption in canine eczema cinsists of a large num \nber of small water pimples or vesicles frequently covering a large extent \nof skin These are formed close together forming quite large water blis \nters When opened these look cellular in structure from the many small \npimples of which they are composed They terminate either by absorption \nor rupture They come in crops and remain for varying periods of time \nAll dogs are liable to attacks of this disease Eczema becomes chronic \nafter repeated attacks When we have a subdued form there is a greater \ntendency to crusting and in severe cases to the formation of pus In the \nblotch lack of exercise constipation overfeeding injurious foods and \nindigestion are the main causes In the red mange form lack of assimila \ntion rheumatism gout and external irritation as lice and ticks act as \ncauses In both of these forms lack of exercise is one of the most impor \ntant causes This results in an overheated blood surcharged with the \npartly assimilated food and in nature seek3 to get rid of this excess of \neffete material by the skinf \n\nThis is carried off by the exudation This is a law of nature when \nthe ordinary channels are clogged to try and excrete these substances \nthrough the skin This is particularly so in cases due to rheumatism where \nnature seeks to rid the system of the excess of uric acid and urates These \nsubstances act as direct irritants to the skin and set up a catarrhal inflam \nmation Washing dogs affected with eczema is to be avoided as much as \npossible as both water and soap act as a direct irritant to the already \ninflamed skin The sulphate of magnesia or soda is in the beginning of \ntreatment of great value When there is much constitutional disturbance \nopium and calomel in grain closes are indicated Benzoated oxide of zinc \nointment in the milder forms is of great benefit Tincture of arnica 15 \nto 20 grains to the ounce of an oily lotion is of value Lotions contain \ning salol or salicylic acid from five to thirty grains to the ounce resorcin \nin the same proportion Dusting powders composed of acetanilid salol \nsalicylic acid or resorcin with sterate of zinc as a base is of value When \ndisease is due to debility mineral tonics and cod liver oil should be given \nWhen the disease becomes chronic stronger remedies must be used oint \nments containing juniper tar green soap and sulphur are of value The \nointment of the nitrate and ammoniate of mercury are much used In \ncases where the skin is especially sensitive silver nitrate 1 grain to the \nounce of water will often effect a cure In the chronic cases especially \niron arsenic calomel and quinine are to be used The animal while under \ngoing treatment should be kept clean and give plenty of exercise An \neruption resembling eczema may be induced by large doses of mercury \nThe skin becomes red and swollen then forms large scales and hardens \nThis eruption is generally limited to the limbs and scrotum Some of the \nsymptoms are salivation loss of appetite eyelids closed dullness offensive \nodor from the skin and rarely death \n\nI now give you Dents article on Eczema written expressly for thia \nbook \n\nIn medical nomenclature eczema is a very comprehensive term It \nis applied to all diseases of the skin except true mange or dog itch and \non account of the irritation set up during an attack of mange it is generally \ncomplicated with eczema which remains to annoy the dog and his owner \nlong after the mange mites are destroyed \n\nDogs are particularly subject to skin diseases that are the bane \nalike of the breeder keeping a large number of dogs in kennels or the \nsingle house pet While true dog itch is common enough ninety per cent \nof all skin diseases are eczema \n\nThere is a close relation between the skin of the dog and his digestive \norgans and a deranged stomach will quickly find expression through an \neruption of the skin any poverty or plethoric condition of the blood will \nalso be expressed in the same way If there is any defect or unhealthy \ncondition of the digestive tract and it is called upon to digest unsuitable \nfood it is only a question of time before poisons are introduced into the \nblood that will produce inflammation and eruptions of the skin Strictly \nspeaking eczema is an inflammation of the skin due to the causes above \nmentioned and numerous others such as old dirty damp bedding lack of \nexercise overfeeding starvation irritation from insects lice fleas or from \n\n\ntrue mange In most cases it can be ascribed to a disordered condition of \nthe blood and general system \n\nEczema assumes a variety of forms In one very common form there \nis first a redness of the entire skin with a dry scaly dandruff that flakes \noff In another form there is an eruption of small distinct pimples or \npapules that do not always break but can be easily felt like shot under \nthe skin In another form there is a formation of scurvy crusts of a yel \nlowish white color that smells like mice and underneath this crust are \nsmall cupshaped ulcers \n\nFollicular mange or red mange is due to a sort of vegetable fungoid \nmite that lives at the base of the hair and around the sebaceus gland \nIt turns the skin a sort of brownish red kills the hair root and is most \ncommonly found along the back near the root of the tail \n\nIn the commonest form of eczema there will first be noticed a patch \non some part of the dogs body that is inflamed or covered with pimples \nThese pimples increase in size and become a vesicle filled with a clear tur \nbulent or purulent fluid This sore breaks the fluid escapes runs over \nthe skin which it irritates and dries into scabs which mat the hair together \nThe inflammation affects the hair follicle the hair drops out leaving bare \nspots and there is a constant exudate of matter which spreads and forms \nmore hare spots The skin becomes ulcerated or thickened and wrinkled \nThe dog is tormented by the intolerable itching past all point of endur \nance scratches himself until he bleeds cannot sleep or eat gets no rest \nand becomes a mere wreck of his former self",

    "Fractures": "Fractures \u00e2\u20ac\u201d While fractures are not of frequent occurrence in well \nordered kennels they belong to that category of accidents against which \nthere is sometimes no safeguard A sudden twist stopping in some hid \nden cavity while galloping over a field jumping a fence or from a car \nriage one of the cleanest breaks of a hind leg occurred to a foxterrier \nbitch of ours while jumping off the carriage seat and catching her hind \nleg in the wire rail guard at the end of the seat so one never knows \nwhen such accidents will happen Simple fractures are so termed when \na bone is broken into two pieces only where a bone is broken into several \npieces it is termed comminuted and when the ends of the broken bone \npierce the skin it is a compound fracture which is the worst of all in the \npiecing To detect a simple fracture is not always easy though of \ncourse the other two conditions are more or less selfevident In the \ncase of a simple fracture the limb should be taken hold of above the \nbruise or injury with one hand and with the other gently move the lower \nportion of the limb If the bone or bones are fractured a grating noise \nwill be heard and the jar of the broken bone can be felt \n\nIn treating this condition great care must be exercised in bringing \nthe broken ends together and it is best that the services of a surgeon be \nprocured In case that is not available or a home cure is decided upon \nthe ends of the fractured bones should be brought opposite each other \nand then splints well secured by bandages must be applied to keep them \nin their places until the two ends are joined This is generally from \nthree to four weeks in the case of a puppy and from a month to six \nweeks in a matured dog If the case is not attended to immediately after \nthe accident the parts swell and this swelling has to be reduced before \nany attempt can be made to set the bones and cold water or ice applied \nto the swelling will easily reduce it Before applying the splints it is \nnecessary to wind a bandage around the limb two or three times from \nthe bottom to the top as this has the effect of preventing the splints \nfrom causing unnecessary irritation The splints which are best made \nof wood of about onesixteenth of an inch in thickness of sufficient length \nto extend over the whole straight surface of the limb should be four in \nnumber viz one for the front of the leg one for the back and one for \neither side of it and they should be just wide enough to cover the part \nof the leg on Which they are placed Before applying them the inside \nof each should be smeared with hot pitch cobblers wax or some such \n6ubstance so that they will adhere to the bandage and not slip and then \nanother bandage which should be of considerable length about six yards \nlong and one inch and a half to two inches wide and which has been \npreviously soaked in a thick solution of gum or common starch should be \n\nwound round the limb from bottom to top The object of the starch or \ngum solution is to give additional support which it does when it gets stiff \nand hardens After the operation the dog should be put into a quiet place \n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d a large hamper or crate does very well \u00e2\u20ac\u201d so that he can rest and not \nmove about but it often happens that the next day the part of the limb \nbelow the bandage is found to be swollen if so the latter should be \nloosened for a short time but it must be tightened again when the swell \ning subsides \n\nThe above treatment is of course only advised in the case of simple \nfractures where an amateur may indulge his surgical skill",

    "Fits are of common occurrence especially in puppies": "Fits are of common occurrence especially in puppies \u00e2\u20ac\u201d fortunately \nthose that are of a dangerous and fatal character are the most rare they \noften cause needless alarm but the dog suffering from a fit of whatever \nkind is not an object to be frightened at but to be commiserated and \nhelped and this requires freedom from a fear for which there is no just \nreason Fits are of many kinds and may be classified as apoplectic fits \ndistemper fits fits from teething fits from worms and suckling fits and \nother causes of excitement are known to produce them even high notes \nof music to which some dogs show a strong objection and are decidedly \nharmful \n\nApoplectic Fits are caused by pressure on the brain from distended \nbloodvessels or effusions of blood The subjects of attack are generally \nthose dogs that are kept in idleness and overfed and the attack may be \nthe result of the animal overloading the stomach with food difficult of \ndigestion The symptoms are loud labored breathing the dog lies mo \ntionless on its side in a state of insensibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there is no frothing at \nthe mouth or champing of the jaws but the eyes are fixed and often blood \nshot Such cases are usually fatal and death is frequently instantan \neous Prompt bleeding is the most likely means of saving the patient \nand then soon as sufficiently recovered a strong purge should be given \nor clysters administered Should these means prove successful it will \nbe necessary to use extreme care to prevent a recurrence of the fit The \ndogs diet must be carefully regulated sufficient healthful exercise al \nlowed or compelled if need be and occasional doses of cooling medicine \ngiven Claytons or Dents Blood Cooling Pills will be just the thing to \ngive Apoplexy in the dog is not often seen in practice \n\nDistemper Fits are caused by congestion or inflammation of the brain \nand often prove fatal \n\nEpileptic Fits are not dangerous but of very common occurrence \nespecially during the heated term and generally happen when the dog is \nat exercise \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sometimes in the case of pointers they are seized when on \n\n\nthe point doubtless from the undue excitement produced When the \ndog is attacked he is first observed to tremble on his legs and on trying \nto run on he staggers and falls down on his side frequently uttering a \nlow moan Struggling to his feet he attempts to move only to repeat the \nfall when he lies stupefied and insensible The legs and the whole mus \ncular system are violently convulsed the clog froths at the mouth the \nhead is violently moved often knocked against the ground the jaws are \nchamped together and sometimes the tongue gets lacerated between the \nteeth and the froth from his mouth becomes tinged with blood the \nbreathing during the fit is labored and irregular The fit generally lasts \nseveral minutes When the convulsions have subsided the dog raises \nhis head opens his eyes with a look ofsurprise and very shortly runs \nabout as if nothing had happened \n\nThe treatment during an epileptic fit is to generally carry the dog to \na dry place where there is some soft material so that he cannot hurt \nhimself in his struggles As soon after as possible give him a dose of \nAntispasmodic Drops Compound spirits of sulphuric ether known as \nHoffmans anodyne and tincture of opium laudanum equal parts \nKeep well corked and cool Dose for 15 to 35 lb dog would be a \nteaspoonful in two tablespoonfuls of

predisposed to epi \nlepsy \n\nSuckling Fits are produced by exhaustion consequent on the bitch \nhaving too many pups left on her She lies or falls down breathing heavily \nbecomes insensible and is frequently much convulsed Remove all the \npups but one or two which must meanwhile be fed on the bottle or by \nspoon condensed milk \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a little at a time but often \u00e2\u20ac\u201d

lasted about 3 minutes she got up and seemed scared had a wild \nlook in her eyes and seemed unable to see well She has those fits now \nonce or twice a day and is very weak but eats well though hardly able to \nstand up The fits she has now are of shorter duration but she seems \nmuch weaker just after one she has a fit soon after she begins to eat \nand is disturbed every morning after she gets over it she will finish her \nbreakfast of soup and rice or milk Will she necessarily die or is she \nincurable I have had a good deal of experience with distemper and \nhave lost eight

    "Hookworms": "Hookworms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The process by which the hookworm reaches the intes \ntines is most interesting The egg or embryo is deposited in fecal matter \nwithin the intestines It hatches or develops after being exposed to air \nand moisture usually within twelve to twentyfour hours if the tempera \nture is above seventy or eighty degrees Fahrenheit In about eight days \nunder favorable conditions such as being on warm wet ground it attains \nfull growth microscopically and is ready to infest which it does by boring \nthrough the skin or mucous membrane of the mouth into the blood canals \nand is carried along with the blood currents to the lungs then it bores \nthrough the walls of the blood canals into the air sacs and crawls up \nthrough the windpipe to the throat and then passes directly to the in \ntestines either by crawling or being swallowed with food or water attaches \nitself to intestinal membranes and begins a life which lasts from six to \nten years unless expelled It subsists entirely upon the blood which it \nsucks After it is attached it grows to a length of onethird to onehalf \ninch the female being somewhat larger than the male as shown in illus \ntration She is very prolific and one dog which is infested will pollute a \n\nvast area of ground by reason of rains washing or spreading the feces \ncontaining thousands of eggs or embryos \n\nThe presence of hookworm is hard almost impossible to detect with \nout the use of a microscope unless the investment is quite heavy then \nrapid decline is noticed such as general weakness or paralysis of the legs \nor hindquarters \n\nSymptoms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Rough hair sometimes a cough as a rule the appetite \ncontinues fairly good languid eyes become bloodless and listless gums \npale generally a creamy white Excretion sometimes natural again loose \nagain of a dysentery nature frequently a little drop of blood or two This \nmay be examined by the average layman many times with the naked eye \nand from the fact that he doesnt see any the conclusion is arrived at \nthat the dog is free of hookworm Many times a dog in apparently the \nbest of health is infected with these terrible pests his strong constitu \ntion overbalancing the damage that Mr Worm is doing This wont last \nalways and sooner or later he will pay the price \n\nWhile a microscopical examination will reveal the eggs it occasionally \nhappens that the worm itself is shown in feces under certain conditions \nOf course a microscopic examination of the feces for the ova is the one \nabsolute certain way of determining a dog having them \n\nThis worm has been discovered in dogs cats foxes badgers and \nhuman beings adults as well as children This is mentioned with the \nview to impress upon all interested the necessity of being alive to the \ntrue situation in order to prevent the scattering of the disease and to \nshow the chances of it being scattered \n\nThe worm attaches itself to the walls of the intestine and lives about \nseven years Remember kennel owners the worm does not incubate in \nthe intestine but simply deposits its thousands of eggs there which are \npassed out on the ground in the excrement I have dissected sixweek \nold puppies and found many hookworms This was no doubt brought \nabout by the dam lying out on the ground her teats being attacked by \nthe freshly hatched worm and brought to the suckling puppies They were \ntreated in the ordinary way for worms but this will not kill hookworms \n\nIf hookworm is found in one dog in the kennel it is safe to assume \nevery dog in the kennel is infected and should be treated \n\nThe following most valuable article is from The American Field writ \nten by Edward Martin M R C V S \n\nUntil quite recently hookworm disease in the dog also known as \npernicious anemia uncinariasis etc has been but slightly recognized This \nis probably owing to neglect on the part of owners of dogs and veterin \narians to make careful postmortem examinations and again to the fact \nthat young dogs infected with hookworm generally carry round worms and \ntapeworms and it is to the effects of these that death when it occurs is \nattributed \n\nThe hookworm parasite technically known as Uncinaria inhabitsthe \nsmall intestines of dogs and foxes When mature they attach themselves \nto the mucous membrane and live entirely on the blood they extract For \nthe purposes of this article they may be described as an extremely fine \nround worm white or grayish in color from onethird to seveneighths of \nan inch in length and about as thick as a fine sewing needle As they can \n\n\nseldom be seen in the stools it may be advisable to describe their appear \nance on postmortem examination of their host \n\nDogs dying from this disease are generally emaciated and when the \npatient has lingered long covered with bedsores The gums are pale often \nspongy and ulcerated the teeth covered with a dark green deposit with a \npronounced odor On opening the abdomen the mesenteric glands are \ngenerally found to be enlarged and dark in color due to irritation set up \nby the poisonous products of the parasites The outer surface of the stom \nach and bowels as a rule show little or no changes in aggravated cases \nthere may be a few dark red or purple spots \n\nTo find the parasites the stomach and bowels should be taken out and \nslit up The parasite does not often occur in the stomach but may be \nfound firmly attached to the wall in any part of the small intestines The \nmucous membrane of the intestines should be examined in a good light \ninch by inch with a magnifying glass and if necessary washed with run \nning water to clear away mucus partly digested food etc \n\nThe parasite can be recognized curled up in a spiral or lying straight in \ngroups of four or five to a dozen They may be evenly distributed through \nout the small intestine If the examination be made shortly after death \neach parasite is found firmly attached in the center of a red inflamed spot \nwherever the contents of the bowels are cherry colored from blood staining \nthe parasites can be found most numerously The whole of the small \nintestine is as a rule inflamed and thickened In many cases round worms \nand tapeworms are also present especially in young dogs \n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis of the Disease \n\nHookworm disease has been looked on as essentially a disease of sport \ning dogs especially hounds As a matter of fact all breeds are equally sus \nceptible and it is simply due to the fact that sporting dogs are generally \nraised and kept where the conditions favor the parasites that it has been \nso considered Dogs at all ages are liable to become infected but grow \ning puppies from a few weeks to a year old are more susceptible to the \neffects of the worms \n\nSymptoms are unfortunately indefinite in the majority of cases The \ndog may show signs of worms and with treatment pass round worms and \ntapeworms but fails to pick up and develop as expected Young puppies \nbecome anemic with pallid gums distended abdomen injected eyes and \na hot dry nose The usual treatment with vermifuges and purgatives \nproduces a persistent diarrhea the worm toxins produce convulsions coma \nand death in a very few days Older dogs from six to twelve months old \npass through these stages more slowly \n\nThe appetite is capricious or voracious the gums become spongy and \nbleed easily to the touch development of teeth is arrested \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in several \ncases I have observed crumbling of the enamel due to faulty assimilation \nof the necessary constituents and to the presence of a foulsmelling green \ndeposit Chorea may develop suddenly and progresses in violence until \ndeath occurs In the course of time diarrhea sets in which increases in \nseverity until bloodstained or tarrylooking movements occur several times \n\nin the hour Rapid emaciation exhaustion and death follow in a few days \nonce dysentery is established \n\nAbsolute diagnosis can only be made by microscopical examinations \nof the stools This however involves considerable technical difficulties \nand for practical purposes may be counted out \n\nTreatment \n\nIn nursing and newly weaned puppies is almost out of the question as \ndrastic remedies cannot be used safely The remedies recommended by \ngovernment experts for uncinariasis in man are thymol male fern oil of \nturpentine and chloroform singly or in combination followed by active \npurgatives In the dog it is advisable to give all vermifuge medicines in \ncapsules or coated pills to prevent nausea and vomiting which occurs when \nmedicines are given in fluid form In the dog better results are produced \nby giving daily doses before feeding each morning In this way dysentery \nis not so liable to be set up as where full treatments are given \n\nThymol is looked on as a specific in the human being but is a most \nunreliable drug for the dog In a number of puppies of the same age weight \n and condition I have found some who would tolerate large doses while in \nothers extremely small doses would produce persistent vomiting convul \nsions and death Extract of male fern in combination with turpentine \nchloroform and castor oil or glycerine is much safer given in small daily \ndoses \n\nDuring treatment tonics such as iron arsenic and strychnine arsenite \nof copper etc should be given and to sustain strength cod liver oil raw \nmeat and milk and eggs should be fed generously To control diarrhea \nbismuth subgallate may be given in large doses it acts as an intestinal \nantiseptic as well as being an astringent \n\nAs a tonic instead of drugs given in this article the writer of this \nbook would use Sergeants Condition Pills in all cases \n\nAs to Prevention \n\nCommencing with the egg it has been found that they are formed and \nundergo changes while in the oviduct of the female After being passed \nout of the dogs bowels with the stools they undergo further changes in \nsurface soil the time occupied depending on the suitability of the surround \nings the essential features being moisture and favorable temperatures \nWhere conditions are favorable the eggs are hatched out in a few days and \nafter the embryos have undergone several moultings they are ready to \ninfect dogs by means of drinking water or contaminated food \n\nThe important features to remember are 1 That the eggs are hatch \ned out not while in the intestine of the dog but after being passed out with \nthe stools From this it follows then that every individual hookworm \npresent in the intestines of the dogrepresents infection by a single embryo \nIn other words the parasites do not actually increase in number while \nin the dogs intestines 2 Moisture is absolutely essential to the hatch \ning out of the eggs Drinking troughs and contaminated water supply are \ntherefore rightly considered as the chief sources of infection \n\n\nFrom these facts it can be seen that the essentials of prevention of \nhookworm disease are absolute cleanliness in every particular especially as \nregards feeding pans and water vessels and disinfection of all excretions \nand soiled bedding When an animal dies the body should be buried in \nquicklime or better still cremated Above all dampness must be avoided \nin every possible way \n\nFor disinfecting sleeping quarters dry sawdust impregnated with a \nreliable disinfectant is of great value as it absorbs moisure and when \nbrushed out carries away and destroys the eggs of the parasite Woodwork \nmay be whitewashed or painted and all floors should be cleaned out at \nleast once daily Earth floors should be covered with boards or concrete \nAs damp soil is the medium in which the embryos develop outdoor runs \nshould be dressed with quicklime well drained and covered with several \ninches of furnace ashes or crushed coke This when alternately rolled and \nsprinkled with crude petroleum will in time form a waterproof asphalt \nlike surface which will carry off water according to the direction in which \nit is sloped All food and drinking water should be given in clean pans \nand under no consideration should dogs be allowed to eat from the floor \nof sleeping quarters or from the ground in the runs To prevent mud from \nbeing carried into the kennels on the feet of kennel men or visitors where \nthe surrounding grounds are liable to be muddy board walks and a door \nmat and scraper at the kennel entrance should be laid down \n\nConfinement to kennel quarters in some districts seems to be the only \nsafe plan to avoid the disease as when allowed to roam at liberty dogs \nwill drink from stagnant of surface water and thus become infected \nSuspected cases should be isolated whenever possible \n\nHookworm disease is not necessarily nor commonly fatal to adult \ndogs in fact in Western Pennsylvania it is the rule rather than the ex \nception to find a few hookworms in dogs dead from other causes It is \nsuch cases that constitute a danger to young and susceptible dogs When \nthe method of reproduction of the hookworm is taken into consideration \nit can be understood that when reinfection is prevented by following the \nprecautions suggested it is quite possible for a dog to

water \n\nWith careful diet and exercise these means will be found successful \nAdd a little lime water to the milk that is given to drink By treating \nthe patient thus and paying strict attention to his dietary and exercise \nthe disease will soon yield \n\nI have used with good results in lieu of the above pill Claytons Di \ngestive Pills and believe to be very good \n\nThe following article I found somewhere and as it is worth repro \nducing here entire I give it space in this book \n\nAs in man and many animals indigestion in the dog may be acute \nchronic and passive In acute indigestion the attack is sudden and painful \nand is the result of an overloaded stomach The disorder is called chronic \nwhen the dog suffers for a continued time and his stomach and intestines \n\n\nare in a weakened condition It is active when the attack is brought on \nby some extrinsic cause passive when it is the result of some other disease \nor is due to an intrinsic cause \n\nThe breeds of dogs most likely to be affected by indigestion are \nthe pug the Japanese spaniel the black and tan the greyhound the \nYorkshire terrier the French poodle and the fox terrier \n\nPugs are probably the greatest sufferers As a rule they are en \ncouraged in laziness while sweetmeats are fed to them indiscriminately \nso that it is not surprising they should become fat and dyspeptic \n\nThe foods which are richest in fats and those which are prone to \nfermentation are the most indigestible but it is not so much the nature of \nthe food as it is the quantity consumed at one time which injures an \nanimals stomach Small dogs are more voracious in their feeding than \nlarge dogs Some dogs never or seldom get a bone to gnaw The dog is a \ncarnivorous animal and in a state of nature he lives only on the flesh of \nother animals As he swallows his food with but little mastication Nature \nhas provided him with a desire to gnaw the bones into small pieces When \nthese small pieces are taken into the stomach they bruise and lacerate the \nfood until it is made thoroughly digestible It is believed that 70 per \ncent of the cases of indigestion in dogs are due to their being deprived \nof bones to gnaw Domestication has to a great extent modified the habits \nof the dog Some pets are pampered and spoiled to the degree that they \nwill eat only certain foods which must be fed to them with a fork or from \nsome particular dish Such peculiarities are predisposing causes to indi \ngestion \n\nA symptom of acute indigestion is vomiting after feeding Later \nthis is followed by general dullness the dog isolates himself from his \nfriends his eyes roll with an expression of fear The muzzle may be dry \nRumbling sounds in the bowel sare heard accompanied by distension of \nthe abdomen which is filled with gas If the animal is forced to move \nhe shows great uneasiness and is stiff in his posterior limbs his back \narched to relieve the tension of the abdominal muscles If the abdomen is \nmanipulated he evinces acute pain The bowels are constipated These \nsymptoms may continue for an hour or more and the attack may pass off \nas suddenly as it began or it may last for some length of time during \nwhich the dog suffers the greatest pain Then the pain ceases his eyes \nbrighten he becomes cheerful and off he goes for a run apparently per \nfectly well \n\nThe symptoms of chronic indigestion are the same as those of the \nacute attack only they are less intense and they continue for days at a \ntime The dog often grows irritable to a state of fenzy and will run about \nsnapping and biting exposing himself to be shot for mad by some over \nzealous policeman \n\nAs regards treatment it is more important to regulate the diet \nthan to give medicines Feed the sufferer once or twice a day not oftener \nand feed him sparingly Give him five 5 grains of saccharated pepsin \nbefore meals and five 5 grains each of subnitrate of bismuth and bi \ncarbonate of soda after meals For small dogs such as terriers black \nand tans Japanese spaniels etc the dose should he reduced onehalf",

\nwhich denote the disease take good hold there is serious trouble ahead and \nleads to complications which deplete the kennel Even if a cure is affected \nthe convalesence is long and subject to a relapse from the most trivial cause \nIn the first stage the symptoms are dullness of the animal loss of appetite \nrigors or shivering fits nose hot then cold increased thirst Second stage \nA discharge from nose and eyes which at first is mucoid and watery but \nit soon becomes of a mattery description the breathing becomes acceler \nated and the conjunctival membrane red this is the lining membrane of \nthe eyelid The symptoms in these first stages are very like the earlier \nsymptoms of distemper and most people seeing one of these cases for the \nfirst time and in a young dog would say it had the latternamed disease \nThe discharge is not however of the purulent offensive character \nthat denotes distemper and the disease is as liable to attack old dogs as \nyoung ones In

hours If the complaint is not \nchecked in its earlier stages one or both of the aftermentioned compli \ncations may set in These complications are affections of the lungs and \nthose of a rheumatismal character When the chest complication is setting \nin the breathing becomes more accelerated and painful the fever increases \nin fact the symptoms are those of ordinary chest complaints and these \nmay be bronchitis congestion and inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy \nAs it requires the skilled practitioner to differentiate one class of chest \ndisease from another it would be useless to attempt to explain to the \namateur how to diagnose this for himself \n\nThe dog should be kept in dry quarters and away from draughts \nThe treatment should be similar to that recommended under Cold The \ndog will however require still greater care exercised in keeping him \nwarm and in a wellventilated place as well as in being supported with \neasilydigested food such as strong broth

Pills instead of the cod liver \noil and iron are just the thing to use here \n\nThe following is also good advice on Influenza \n\nSymptoms The disease is commonly located in the mucous mem \nbrane of the nose the lungs and air passages The first symptoms are \nthose of a common cold chill lassitude shivering sneezing and loss of \nappetite The small veins of the eye and membranes are injected and \nthere is a profuse discharge of tears as well as a swelling of the nasal \nmembranes The throat becomes sore and there is a dry hoarse cough \nthat is sometimes so severe as to terminate in

    "Mange": "Mange \u00e2\u20ac\u201d A troublesome and in some forms the most loathsome dis \nease met with in the dog occurring in so many forms as to be not always \neasy of distinction The trouble with too many dog owners is that when \nany skin trouble appears they are most likely to call it Mange Mange and \nEczema are too often confounded and as there is a decided difference \nmange being a skin trouble due to a parasite while eczema is a blood \ntrouble the two diseases require different treatment The term mange as \napplied to animals is identical with itch in the human race in both of \nwhich exist parasite life in the skin and is a cutaneous disease The very \npronounced distinction between true mange and eczema and other causes \nof irritation of the skin is that mange is caused by a parasite invisible to \nthe naked eye and that it is transferable by contact from one animal to \nanother while eczema blotch surfiet or red mange is not And while a \nwhole kennel may be suffering from the latter compalints it must be be \ncause all have been subjected to conditions of life occasioning derange \nment of the system eczema remains an individual disease and is never \ntransmitted True mange resembles itch in man as it is due to a small \nparasite that burrows or tunnels through the skin in all directions draw \ning its nourishment therefrom The female deposits her eggs In the canals \nformed which hatch out in about two weeks the young continue bur \nrowing and occasion intense itching True mange is entirely a local affec \ntion and the uneasiness and loss of sleep causes the animal to continually \nscratch and bite itself in Its vain efforts to allay the intolerable pain and \nitching This has a very debilitating effect upon the system and will soon \ntransform a healthy and sleek coated pet into a loathsome object \n\nThe cause is invariably the result of having met some dog or other \nanimal that w affected with mange One dog meeting another or occu \n\n\nr 1 \n\npying his kennel or sleeping quarters or being shipped in a crate that \nwas used by a dog with mango will surely contract it Absolute clean \nliness is necessary in the treatment of mange When your dog shows \nsigns of mange remove it immediately from its quarters to new ones \nburn the bedding it has used wash its kennel with boiling water to which \nhas been added the Standard Disinfectant or Sanitas See advertisement \nof both in this book Either one if thoroughly applied will destroy \nevery parasite in the kennel \n\nNow give your dog a good bath with Eberharts Dog Soap using quite as \nWarm water as the dog c \u00e2 i ii stand cleansing its entire body and opening the \npores of the skin After drying the dog thoroughly then apply Eberharts \nSkin Cure all over the dog rubbing it in well with your bands and not \nmissing a spot on tbe dogs body for if yon do you leave some parasites \n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d a very busy and industrious pest they are \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and in a day later many new \nborn ones would be hard at work again Take plenty Of lime in putting \non this skin cure using plenty of elbow grease applying it the same \nas you would a liniment Repeal this the next day and probably Eor two \ndays more the bath not being strictly essential except the first day If \nyou wish or the dog is a house dog you can give It a bath after the skin \ncure has been on for ball an hour for it has then done its work this bath \nsimply to put the dog in more presentable and cleaner shape as all skin \nor mange cures contain oil of some kind and are therefore greasy There \nare several good mange cures aside Itom mine \n\nOrdinarily a case of mange should be cured in a week or two and \nafter three or four applications all over the dog it is only necessary to \napply it daily to the sore places or where no hair as my skin remedy is \nalso a great hair grower and never fails to restore the hair unless tbe \nhair roots have been destroyed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d when nothing will bring back the hair \nIt is not necessary to change the food in treating mange \n\nA very good mange euro is the following \n\nTrain oil 4 gallon \n\nVenice turpentine 2 ounces \n\nOil of tar y2 ounce \n\nLac Sulphur \u00e2\u20ac 1 pound \n\nFirst mix the oil and turpentine and then add the oil of tar and sulphur \nYour druggist may not have train oil as it is often hard to procure If so \ncommon black oil or crude petroleum will do just as well \n\nAll mange cures should bo applied the same as directed in vising mine \n\n\u00e2 \u00e2 he following as a dip was recommended by a friend who used it in \nhis kemols The only objection I can see is that it would not do to use \nin cold weather \n\nFor quick cure of mange use 1 quart of Standard Oil of Tar to 10 \nquarts of water have water as hot as possible without scalding or burning \nband mix thoroughly place liquid In small narrow tub one that will just \nfl the dog if possible place dog In tub take cup and pour the liquid all \novur him Beginning at head just below ears saturate dog thoroughly \nloosen up all old scabs applying well tbe eure to affected parts Take stiff \n\nbrush wet with liquid brush dog thoroughly remove dog from tub give \nhim a bed of clean straw to roll in do not rinse off with clean water or \nrub skin dry Do not allow dog to roll in dirt immediately after his \nwash as he will if not chained up or placed in a room Rolling in sand \nafter a wash will irritate the sores and make the cure all the harder When \nabout dry the sore spots may be touched up with equal parts of water \nand Standard Oil of Tar In curing mange the bedding must be changed \nevery day wash all woodwork where dog rubs once every week with hot \nwaicr in which has been placed Standard Oil of Tar \n\nThere is no use in taking medicine unless you follow your doctors \nadvice so dont expect the desired result unless you follow directions as \none or two applications will not effect a cure in a case Of mange Mange \ncan be cured no matter how bad a case it appears to be if you go at it \nright and have the right remedy in fact it is one of the easiest to cure of \nall troubles The reason why so many people dread this disease is be \ncause of their failure to cure what they wrongly suppose is mange when \nit perhaps is eczema which is a much longer story but can also be cured \nand the treatment of which is given under that heading Remember that \nif you have more than one dog the others will get it unless the afflicted \none is removed and isolateu in time The advantage of having a regular \nkennel or place for each dog to sleep is manifest in treating the dog for \nmange as thus you can disinfect his kennel and destroy the bedding which \nare both infected whereas if your dog was sleeping any place he wanted \nto in your house this would be a very difficult matter and while you cured \nhim he could again contract it by coming in contact with the parasites that \nhad not been destroyed \n\nYou need not have any fear of con i racting mange from your dog \nI have treated many cases for years past and never got it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not transmit \nable from the dog to man \n\nThere are several skin diseases called by different names or desig \nnated as different kinds of mange but the treatment I have given for \nmange and the one for eczema about covers the whole ground of skin \ntrouble or my remedy will cure them all excepting that in some of them as \nin eczema internal remedies must also be used at the same time to work \non the blood Eczema is fully treated elsewhere Carbolic acid is used \nin many mange cures a dangerous ingredient unless carefully used and \nin small quantities \n\nMy longtime friend Harry Y Lacy editor of American Fancier and \nStockkeeper has this to say of mange read it also \n\nIt is quite true that eczema or red mange is to some extent con \ntagious but we have not found it to be so to any extent which would justify \nthe term being applied to it It is desirable always to keep a dog affected \nwith skin disease away from other dogs because constant contact in the \nkennel or at play is liable to give rise to an exchange of skin complaint \nOn the other hand a dog with distemper which is very contagious is made \nto give it to animals which never come mar to him and a dog with \nfleas will furnish a supply to ail his fellows in the neighborhood In most \ncases mange is however not due to contact by the victim with another \nmangy cur but is due to outandout neglect Mange is never known in \nkennels where the dogs are properly looked after it is a cultivation of the \n\n\nHObackyard and thrives best upon the poor chainedup brute that is more \nhuman than his owner who keeps him chained there In a word filth ia \nthe soil on which alone the sarcoptic parasite can thrive \n\nA dog with ordinary skin irritation developing into redness and \nrash has acquired that in one of two ways Either he has an hereditary \npredisposition to skin complaint and here let it be said that this heredi \ntary predisposition is a very common fact and is due undoubtedly in a \ngreat measure to the inbreeding which has been carried on to a greater or \nless extent in all breeds or else he is suffering from impurity in the blood \nwhich may be clue to overfeeding or liver complaint or want of sufficient \nexercise or any one of a dozen other things If the former be the case it is \nby no means probable that a cure will be effected and the most important \nthing that can be done is in the direction of preventing the disease from \nbeing handed down to other generations If it is intended to breed from \nthe dog it should be mated with the newest blood possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is to say \nwith an animal having a very different pedigree from its own The disease \nis certain to reappear even after the dog has been apparently cured A \nhange of diet or of weather will always be liable to precipitate a fresh \nattack \n\nThe following treatise on mange was written by Dalziel and to it your \nattention is called A very able handling of the subject",
    "Sarcoptic Mange": "Sarcoptic Mange \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The mite producing this most nearly resembles the \nitchmite of man and as it is propagated by eggs and transmitted by \ncontact direct or indirect there seems nothing impossible in the idea of \nstamping out this chief enemy to the comfort of a brave spaniel if only \nwe could get every clog owner to be careful and clean There is much virtue \nin an if but at least we can learn from the facts about the mangemite \nthat we need not harbor it in our own kennels and by stamping it out \nthere lessen it generally Dirt unquestionably harbors and encourages \nmange although it does not produce it left undisturbed by cleansing pro \ncesses the pests breed and multiply with great rapidity \n\nWhen the mite reaches the dog it burrows into the skin the pro \ncess and also a poisonous fluid discharged by the creature causes intol \nerable itching and to relieve this the dog scratches with the result that \nthe skin is broken small red points appear and these become pustular \nand discharge a fluid which dries or crusts and forms a scab the hair \nfalls off The multiplication of the original cause of the evil is rapid and \nleft unchecked the whole surface of the body soon becomes involved \nwhile the poor dog is an object of pity and from want of rest and other \ncauses sinks into a helpless condition This state is often called virulent \nor scabby mange and presents many of the characteristics of Blotch The \nskin is harsh dry and rough until small pimples appear when therefrom \noozes a purulent matter forming scabs which mat the hair together and \nbring it off in patches as the dog rubs or scratches himself The back \nbreast and inside of the thighs are generally the first places attacked and \nevery crease and wrinkle in the skin becomes inflamed and moist with the \nirritating discharge If the disease is left unchecked it soon extends over \nthe whole body reducing the dog to a deplorable condition disgusting to \nall who see him and intolerable to himself These are severe and extreme \neases In others a dry scurfy mange exists marked by little red spots \n\n\n \n\nand confined to the joints of the legs over the eyes the flaps of the ears \netc and this may exist for some time without other damage than causing \nthe dog great uneasiness and injury to his appearance by partially destroy \ning the hair and robbing it of its natural glossy appearance \n\nThe first thing to be done with a mangy dog is to wash him Let him \nhave a good sousing and scrubbing with a good soap and water hottish \nrather but not so boiling as to turn him red dry well with a soft cloth \nwhich mast immediately be boiled and then dress him with one or the \nother of the several well known mange cures Whatever you use see that \nit is applied thoroughly see that it reaches the skin where the mites are \nand is not merely left on the hair Chronic cases of mange often take a \nmonth or two to cure Sulphur is given as an internal remedy for mange \nbut it is not of any use in mange \n\nFollicular Mango is due to another mite Demodex folloculorum very \ndifferent in appearance from the other Saroptes which are short and \nthick whereas this the Demodex is elongated and with a long obtuse \ntail These parasites differ in their habits the Demodex living in the \nhairfollicles and burrowing deep under the skin in the sebaceous gland \nthat supplies the unctous matter to protect the skin and keep it soft \nThe depth to which the Demodex burrows renders Follicular Mange much \nlets easy of transmission between dogs but it also makes a cure much \nmore difficult as the parasites are hard to reach This mite is identical \nwith a parasite found in the human skin causing some disfiguration of \nthe face but further than that it does no harm until transferred to the \ndog when it causes a most repulsive disease and one very difficult to \n\u00e2\u20acradicate \n\nSome few yean ago Mr Wm Hunting FRSVS in conjunction with \nProfesor Duguid made a series of investigations and experiments in eluci \ndation of this disease and the following description of symptoms and \nthe diagnosis are from an article by the former gentleman which appeared \nin the Veterinary Journal and afterward in pamphlet form \n\nThe symptoms of the disease are seldom seen in the first stages they \nconsist merely of circumscribed spots from which the hair fallsy and upon \nwhich are noticeable a few small pimples These patches extend rapidly and \nfresh ones appear on other parts Any portion of the skin may be affected \nbut the head legs belly and sides are usually the seat of the disease \nThe affected places are almost hairless and what hair remains is easily \npulled out small pimples and pustules stud the surface the latter varying \nin size from a pins head to that of a pea The confluence of the pustules \nand the discharge of their contents give rise to scabs these crack and \nbleed and so produce a most repulsive appearance In whitehaired dogs \nIhe skin is red in all it is extremely hot and emits an unpleasant odor \nThe irritation does not excite much scratching but the dog frequently \nshakes himself More pain than itshing seems to accompany the disease \nIn cases where the whole body is affected loss of condition is most marked \nand in cold weather the almost total loss of hair may cause death if the \nanimal be not kept in a warm place This stage too is always accom \npanied by ravenous appetite due probably to the rapid loss of animal \nheat \n\n\nDiagnosis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d In white clogs the color of the skin may cause the disease \nto be mistaken for Red Mange or Eczema The circumscribed spots in \nthe first stages may be confounded with some forms of Tinea and the loss \nof hair and the presence of scabs seen in the fully developed disease may \neasily be mistaken for ordinary scabies The pustules the heat of the skin \nand the comparatively slight itchiness shown are however nearly diagnos \ntic Positive diagnosis can only be made by the aid of the microscope and \nthe detection of the parasite If we puncture one of the pustules and mix \nits contents on a slide with a little water the acari are easily discovered \nI have found as many as thirty to one pustule Sometimes we may detect \nthem on the root of a hair removed from an affected spot With a low \npower the parasites somewhat resemble sprats or minnows but a higher \npower shows them to consist of a head and body which latter terminates \nin a long and obtusely pointed tail They are furnished with six or eight \nlegs situated on the anterior part of the body three or four on each side \nThe head consists of two antennse and a median proboscis all of which \nare capable of being moved forward or backward The legs consist of \nthree segments The movements of the creatures are not often seen and \nare very slow The parasite measures about onehundredth of

sucking \nPediculi always cause more or less itching consequently a tendency to \n\u00e2 cratch This is not all but in many cases they lead to the formation of \nscabs \n\nThe female is larger than the male and deposits her eggs or nits \nupon the hairs attaching each one thereto by a tough transparent sheath \nThe female lays about 50 eggs wEtich are hatched in two days \n\nTreatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d It is not usually a very difficult matter to get rid of lice \nThorough cleanliness is essential with disinfection and destruction of all \nmaterial with which the animal has been in contact Sucking pups are \nfrequently affected in which case the treatment must be directed to both \nparent and offspring After cleansing of the kennel destruction of the \nbedding material etc the former should be washed with soft soap and \nwarm watr afterwards dressed with the following solution Stavesacre \nseads 1 ounce water 1 quart The seed must be boiled for about an hour \n\nin Water and then adding sufficienl water to bring if up to a quart again \nWith this the dog should be thoroughly dressed from head to tail taking \ncare not to leave one hair untouched It is certain death to both parasite \nand eggs After 24 hours it may be washed off and if necessary applied \nagain The suckling pups must be combed before being given back to their \nmother This must be repeated daily until they are perfectly free from \nvermin They may also be dressed with the same solution but it should \nbe diluted five ounces of camphor being added to five ounces of camphor \nwater Of course washing is here inadmissable Another remedy which \nis equally effectual is a weak solution of lime and sulphur lotion whilst \nfor animals of a more mature age it may be used of the ordinary strength \n\nThe following will also destroy lice \n\nFlour of sulphur 1 pound \n\nUnslacked lime y2 pound \n\nWater 1 gallon \n\nSlake the lime in the water stir in the sulphur adding water gradually \nuntil it is of a creamy consistence then add the remainder of the gallon \nand boil down to half a gallon let it stand till cool pour off the clear \nliquid and make the quantity to two and a half quarts with cold water \nIf the coat and skin is thoroughly saturated with this and left on for ten \nminutes the vermin will all be dead when the dog should then be well \nwashed using warm water and thoroughly combed and dried This may \nbe too strong a solution for delicate toy dogs with tender skins and can \nbe reduced in strength by adding equal parts of water to one of the lotion \nIf any doubt exists as to this first try the weaker solution \n\nAnother and a harmless and nonpoisonous remedy for lice is Eber \nharts Skin Cure which will do the work if wrell rubbed in never missing \na spot on the dog allowed to remain in for half an hour and applied again \ntwentyfour hours later \n\nThese dressings should be repeated in eight days in order to destroy \nthe young lice from the nits or eggs laid before the previous dressing \n\nHere I give also a very good article on Lice which I found some \nwhere and it is worth including \n\nLice cause great irritation and will eventually if means are not taken \nto rid the dog of the living burden take the blood out of the dog and even \ntually cause death Of course that is extreme but a bunch of such para \nsites if not heroically handled will soon get ahead of the operator and \nthen there is nothing to do but shave the animal and give it a strong \nsoaking in some mixture that will kill the nits Mercurial ointment is \na sure knocker but it is not advisable for the novice to use unless in \nstructed in its application and the precaution to be taken that the dog \ndoes not lick the ointment afterwards and thus become more or less \npoisoned This is obviated by muzzling until the ointment wears off or \nis washed off \n\nThe best thing we have found is an emulsion made of onethird very \nhot milk mixed with twothirds kerosene oil We generally mix it in a \nkandy bottle with a shake stopper and opening the coat drop in the emul \n\n\nsion which of course must be well shaken while being applied The milk \ncounteracts any blistering of the skin that might arise from the application \nof the oil alone This kills everything living and saturates the eggs which \nare the source of course of future trouble and the reason some people \nfind it impossible to get rid of lice while the dog lives This treatment \nis not only death to lice but life to the coat bringing it out in glossy \nprofusion The milk must be very hot but not boiling or it will curdle \nin the oil When the emulsion has dried in it is well to wash the dog \nthough this is not absolutely necessary unless the odor of kerosene is \noffensive \n\nHowever many cures one may make the best one is prevention and \nthe measures to be adopted will occur to any intelligent dog owner At the \nsame time if it is a case of the home dog as above it is very difficult to \nhandle and unless periodic treatment is given the dog the trouble will get \nahead before you are aware In the kennels one may adopt heroic \nmeasures in the way of burning partitions and the like nests but in a \nkitchen however clean it may be kept there are little nooks and cracks \nthat cannot be so strenuously treated for the dog may lie around in many \nplaces Applications of strong disinfectants like Standard Disinfectant is \nvery good for this purpose \u00e2\u20ac\u201d See their ad in this book \n\nNaturally dogs that are kept in clean auarQrs and groomed every \nday do not have lice unless as we hinted above they touch some dog that \nhas lice or come in contact with some place where lice dogs frequent This \nmay seem superfluous advice to the wise owner of dogs but it is just this \nignorance on the part of novice owners of dogs that breeds lice and kin \ndred parasites that start skin troubles and all sorts of derangements sauced \nby continual scratching and the nervous condition in which a dog infested \nwith lice soon finds itself The emulsion spoken of above may be used \nwith safety on any dog Should a pet dog start any such trouble rubbing \nwith alcohol will usually put a quietus on the vermin \n\nThe writer has just tried for the first time Standard Disinfectant \non an Irish setter that came back from a show with lice he got there and \nin two thorough applications using a stiff brush to apply it I cleared \nthis dog of the lice I put three ounces Standard Disinfectant in a pail \nthen added a gallon of water to it and then used a sponge for his head \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2 \nthen use a stiff brush for rest of his body legs and tail applying it liberally \nIn ten minutes after I thoroughly dried him with rough towels Only two \napplications were necessary in his case as I did not miss a spot on him \nbut sometimes it might be necessary for more applications if you had \nmissed a few lice \n\nA special

the bones being imperfectly developed \nthe food and other conditions on which the pup is reared not yielding \nthe constituents necessary to give them the required hardness to enable \nthem to perform their proper functions This state is known as rickets \nand the cause being plain the treatment is evident Continuous inandin \nbreeding is one cause of rickets \n\nDo not attempt to rear a pup on a weakly unhealthy mother but if \ntbe breed Is desired procure for the pups a fostormotner of undoubted \n\n\n \u00e2 137 \n\nhealth and stamina let the nest be in a warm airy place and as soon \nas the pups are able to leave the nest let them have plenty of room fresh \nair warmth and sunshine if possible and insure thorough cleanliness \nof the place in which they are kept When old enough to eat let their diet \nbo light nourishing and digestible and rickets will be avoided In cases \nwhere rickets already exist attend to the above suggestions let a con \n siderable portion of the diet consist of good milk to which add a little \nlime water say a tablespoonful to every quarter pint and give in the food \nsmall doses of cod liver oil twice a day for some months \n\nThe following is from Notes for Novices published in the American \nStockkeeper \n\nA great deal has been said and written on the subject of rickets in \npuppies In a great many cases the trouble is brought on by allowing \nthem to play and roll about at an early age on a brick floor If it is \nrfressary to keep puppies in a house with brick floor it should be covered \nver with movable boards under which is a layer of disinfected sawdust \nso a to prevent the propagation of insects \n\nAs an internal remedy for puppies which are rickety nothing is much \nbetter than Parrishs Chemical Food which contains iron and other phos \nphates and must improve the state of the bone system Cod liver oil emul \nsion with hypophosphites is also excellent and alternate doses of each \nmay be given with benefit \n\nThe use of liniments depend on circumstances If the leg weakness is \ncaused by the puppy having been kept on a brick floor as suggested it is \npossible to put matters all right again by the use of liniment only But \nif due to phvsical weakness less Will depend upon external application \nthan upon internal remedies given and general dieting and management \nAs a good allround liniment there is nothing better than ordinary hartshorn \nand oil liniment with a liberal allowance of turpentine \n\nDent prescribes as follows \n\nWhat is the matter with my St Bernard puppy six months old H \nwalks like a person would with rheumatism it all seems to be in his \nforelegs he followed my buggy one day and got very warm and then got \nvery wet He is quite large and fleshy weight one hundred and ten pounds \nAns \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Rickets give him a dessertspoonful of precipitated phosphate of lime \nin his food three times a day also feed him four ounces of lean beef \ndaily and egg shells finely broken up and mixed in with his soft food \n\nThe following was published in Field and Fancy in reply to request \nfrom a subscriber \u00e2\u20ac\u201d written by Dr O V Brumley Professor of Canine \nDiseases of the College of Veterinary Department State University of Ohio \n\nWhat is the cause of rickets I have two puppies that have rickets \nnow are quite valuable ones and would like to save them if possible They \nfirst commenced to show evidences of the disease about two months ago \nand now one of them has peculiar enlargements around the joints on the \nfront limbs also on its face which gives it a very peculiar appearance The \nother one is not quite so bad yet but seems to be getting worse all the \ntime Could you suggest anything that would help them \n\nThere has been a great many theories advanced in regard to the \ncause of this disease and in many instances they do not seem to be en \n\n\n13S xtirely satisfactory Among the many things that have been mentioned an \nthe cause of rhachitis the following will suffice at this time A deficiency of \nlimesalts as a consequence of disturbances of digestion excessive forma \ntion of carbonic acid or lactic acid which would dissolve the limesalts an \nalteration of the general nutritive condition on account of abnormal influ \nences in young animals enlargement and an increase in the number and \nsize of blood vessels in the bone tissues so that the limesalts continue to \ncirculate in the blood instead of being deposited in the bones It might \nbe well to mention that at the present time the exact cause of this disease \nis not known but we do know however that rickets can be developed in \nthe dog by deficient improper food by want of nitrogenous food and espe \ncially bones as it has been demonstrated that animals with this disease if \ngiven these articles of diet seem to improve in a short time This disease \ngenerally makes its appearance in young animals in the first few months \nof their lives and for this reason also it is very often spoken of as heredi \ntary The disease seems to develop relatively in proportion to their growth \nif the animal grows quickly the disease will appear quicKly if growth is \nslow the disease will come on gradually \n\nSPECIAL EXPERIMENTAL TO PROVE THE MENDELIAN LAWS \n\n\nIn calling the attention of our readers to the

before and much \ngood is being done for the breed Get in touch with this kennel If you are \ninterested in collies \n\nThis disease is a peculiar disturbance of the bones of the whole \nSystem and seems to be a deficiency of limesalts in the bones making \nthem solft and flexible The bones become soft enough so that they can \nbe cut easily with a knife and the ends of the bones become much thick \nened which accounts for the peculiar enlargements mentioned abor \nIt is very often that the enlargements make their appearance on the bones \nof the face which gives the animal that peculiar expression Deformed \nand distorted bones are very frequent occurrences in this disease especially \nnoticeable in the limbs which no doubt comes from the weight of the \nanimal at the time the bones are soft The disease as a rule is chronic and it \ntakes a long course of treatment to bring them to a normal condition \nagain and very often the treatment is not satisfactory I have in mind a \ncase now that entirely recovered from the disease but it was a mild one and \nwas treated before the bones were much deformed If the disease is taken \nearly it may be checked by means of proper feding but

    "Tape Worm": "Tape Worms I warned against \nthe use of Areca Nut \n\nBetter give too small a dose than an over dose of any Vermifuge \nand give it oftener or as long as you see signs of the dog having worms \nThe three principle kinds that infest dogs are \n\nFirst \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The Common Round or Stomach Worm of a pale pink or flesh \ncolor pointed at both ends and from two to six inches long in appearance \nvery much like the common earth or fish worm this kind is most common \nin puppies \n\nSecond \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The Tape Worm which is made up of flat sections joined to \ngether and these sections being from a quarter to an inch in length and \nin color nearly white the tail being the largest and longest section which \ngradually gets smaller and shorter toward the head to such an extent that it \nlooks to the naked eye as fine as a thread Under a strong glass this part \nwill look like a lot of very small beads strung on a fine thread Here is \nwhere to look for the head which is described by Stonehenge as follows \nThe head is small and generally hemispherical broader than long and \noften as truncated anteriorly the four mouths or oscula are situated \non the anterior surface and surround the central rostellum which is very \nshort terminated by a minute opical papilla and surrounded by a double \ncircle of small recurved hooks The head can seldom be seen or found \nwith the naked eye It is larger than the neck but yet too small to be \nseen unless under a glass \n\nThird \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The Maw Worm or pin or thread worm as it is variously \ncalled is located in the rectum and is nearly pink in color and from a \nhalf to an inch long These are the least dangerous of all worms but \ncause great irritation They are passed adhering to the feces In puppies \nthese sometimes cause partial paralysis which disappears after the worms \nare passed Some authors claim that the maw worm are segments of the \ntape worm but I think it is a separate species altogether The common \nround stomach worms which inhabit the stomach and small intestines are \nmost to be feared of all being more peculiar to puppies causing irritation \nof the stomach and intestines indigestion fits diarrhea and obstruction \nof the bowels Your puppy has a much greater chance to live when the \nworms are gotten rid of as their presence leads to so many dangerous \ncomplications \n\nFourth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Hook Worms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d these you will find treated under a special \narticle elsewhere \n\nDalziel says The varieties of worms Infesting dogs are very num \nerous far more so than dog owners in general have the slightest idea of \nbut some varieties fortunately are rare A variety has been found in the \neye another in the nasal sinuses where it causes great irritation the cruel \nThread Worm finds its way into the heart producing a most painful death \nBorne are found in the blood the liver has its parasite so have the kid \nney and urethra \n\nAs has been the custom of writers and owners of dogs to classify them \n\n\n1under the headings of roundworm mawworm and tapeworm I have \nin this article done the same as these are the kinds that mostly concern \ndog owners \n\nSymptoms of Stomach Worms in young puppies are plain to be seen \nthey pass them also vomit them up they cause Diarrhea and you will \nfind mucus or slime and sometimes blood in the passage You will also \nnotice a distension and hardness of the stomach very much disproportion \nate to amount of food they have eaten and you may notice the puppy drag \nging itself on its stern or biting at its tail In older dogs most of these \nsame symptoms appear as well as others here enumerated a foul breath \nnose is hot and dry hacking cough fits vomiting of their food mixed with \nmucus rough and staring coat indigeston disturbed sleep colic pains and \nemaciation \n\nThe question is often asked at what period after service should a \nbitch be treated for worms or rather how soon before whelping A fort \nnight or three weeks is about the limit after service but they have been \ntreated without bad result within three weeks of whelping \n\nIf you have your puppies confined in a yard it is very easy to watch \ntheir passages and this is one of the surest ways of all then as soon as \nyou see mucus or worms passed you know they have them and can go to \nwork at once to treat them Now as to stomach or round worms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if they \nappear before pups are weaned in such quantities that you deem it advis \nable or safest to treat as it most generally is select the vermifuge you \nwish to use and then be guided as to size of dose and age of puppy \n\nNow here on this most important subject of Worms I want to say all \nthe good I can for the sake of saving the puppies You will find advertised \nin this book worm remedies made by Glover Clayton Polk Miller and the \nVermilax Company and the C S R Remedy Co Look them up in the \nvery interesting and valuable lot of advertisements you will find in this \nbook as beneficial and important even if they are advertisements and \npaid for to insert as in using these already prepared vermifuges you \ncannot go amiss if their directions and what I say as to administering them \nis followed I have used every one of them and it is far better to use \nsome one of these well known worm remedies that are made for dogs by \nreliable and experienced parties in treating dogs than to take chances or \ngo to the trouble of having other prescriptions filled I am not getting \npaid extra to recommend anyones vermifuge for I would not do so unless \nI thought and believed the article would save puppies \u00e2\u20ac\u201d my main object \nin this book being to do good to dogs I could give you \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as most dog \nbooks do give \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a lot of prescriptions but only give one so that in case \nyou do not happen to have on hand or cannot get one of these mentioned \nthen you could get this one filled and use till you could order one of the \nothers Right here I want to say \u00e2\u20ac\u201d never use areca nut for worms in any \nform or any vermifuge that contains this dangerous drug if you know \nit for while it expels the worms by the fast train route it also kills \nmore dogs by far than it ever saves Areca nut is a relic of a past decade \n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d avoid its use \n\nThe following article on Symptoms of Worms was published in Field \nand Fancy I think written by F J Skinner and certainly worthy of \nspace in this book \n\nWhat are the symptoms by which it can be determined that a dog \nIs suffering from worms As regards puppies the symptoms are very \nclear \n\nThey begin to get thin and they have an appearance that can best \nbe described by the not very euphonious or deiicate but certainly vivid \ndescription of potbellied \n\nThis means that the round worms with which they become infested \ndevelop to such an extent as to give them a hanging appearance which \nevery one that has had experience in raising puppies will speedily recognize \nas symptomatic of the presence of worms \n\nThe puppies become very voracious yet do not seem to thrive and in \na majority of cases they have fits and unless relief be given very soon \nthey will die In these fits \n\nAnother symptom is diarrhoea which of course is due to the irritated \ncondition of the intestines \n\nThe administration of worm medicine in any shape or form how \never simple to puppies is always attended with no small amount of risk \nand for this reason as it seems to us \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that the effect of a mild dose of \nmedicine is simple to stir up the worms when a puppy is badly infested \nwhich is practically as bad as giving an overstrong dose \n\nThe mild dose stirs them up and causes a fit when the overstrong dose \nmay have what is practically a poisonous effect Repeat the dose in a mild \ner form in about a week and then it will be safe to assume that the puppy \nhas been cleared entirely After this take the precaution to give from time \nto time some little laxative medicine In this way you can effectively \nprevent the development of worms to any serious extent and so there will \nnot be any further need for the stronger vermifuges which are required \nwhen a puppy is badly infested \n\nThe following are among the many symptomatic indications of worms \n\nThe Eyes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Pupils almost constantly dilated the eyelids nearly closed \nas though aching which is aggravated by motion sensitive to light the \nwhites of eyes red and in jested patient acts as though sight were de \nfective being guarded in its movements eyeballs roll about in distorted \nfashion opacity of the lens and amaurotic conditions \n\nThe Nose \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Great irritation evidenced by frequent rubbing on the \nground or with the paws \n\nThe Tongue \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The dorsum centrally coated with yellow fur on the \nsides appear round or oval spots of a pink or deep crimson color occasion \nally slightly elevated when vomiting and diarrhoea are present accom \npaniments and spots are observed through the coating of fur \n\nThe Mouth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Dribbling of slimy saliva especially during sleep breath \nfetid and very offensive frequent grinding of the teeth both when asleep \nand awake \n\nCough \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Dry short and spasmodic \n\nAppetite \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Capricious depraved frequently ravenous occasionally in \nabeyance \n\nHeart \u00e2\u20ac\u201d

\nthe hindquarters protrusion of the mucous membrane and prolapse of the \nparts \n\nSkin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Coat rough stands on end abundant scurf herpetic eruptions \nthick and lacking usual

sleeplessness depression restlessness suddenly jumps up out of sleep \nwhines and cries out a with fear epilepy chorea \n\nThe presence of worms naturally tends to reduce a dog in condition \nand many dogs remain permanently so until a thorpugh dosing is given \nthem which is effective in ridding them of the nuisance \n\nAs to worms it is never necessary to consult a veterinarian in fact \nsafer not to do so as too many of them prescribe and use medicines that \nare dangerous have to be given too often and in too large quantities In \ncase you are where you cannot get the vermifuges I have mentioned and \ncannot wait till you could get them then here is a prescription for worms \n\nOil of male shield fern 1 dram \n\nSantonine 8 grains \n\nFluid extract of jalap 1 ounce \n\nOlive oil 1 ounce \n\nOil of anise 20 drops \n\nDose for puppies two to four months old one and a half teaspoons \nful seven to ten months old two and grown dogs two and a half \nor three teaspoonfuls given on an empty stomach \nr \n\nAbove doses are for dogs that weigh when grown from 50 pounds \nto 100 pounds For smaller dogs weighing about 25 pounds take two \nthirds and toy dogs of about 10 pounds take onethird the above doses \nIn treating puppies with this remedy give only one dose on old dogs re \npeat once or twice \n\nThere is no use giving any worm remedy unless the dog has been \nprepared for it by a proper fasting and the medicine is put in them when \nbowels are empty You must catch the worms by fishing for them when \nthey are hungry the exception of this rule being of course in the case of \ntreating puppies yet unweaned This is as before said not so often ne \ncessary \n\nDr Clayton furnishes me directions as to giving his Vermifuge as \nfollows The dose for toy dog ten days old is two to five drops twenty \ndays old fiv to ten drops thirty days old ten to thirty drops Medium and \n\nlarge breeds twice and three times the amount to be varied by the size \nand strength of the animal and can be given with perfect safety I have \nyet to see one unpleasant result of the Vermifuge and I will pay for any \npup that has been properly treated with my Vermifuge in time that dies \nof worms I will put up twice the value of the pup and after I have given \na dose of my Vermifuge if the pup dies and there is found one worm the \nowner takes the money if there are no worms the owner stands the loss \nI absolutely guarantee to remove all worms with my remedies without \ninjury to the animal and you cannot speak too highly of my worm reme \ndies \n\nDr Clayton further says Puppies never do so well as when get \nting the nourishment from the mother and if it is possible to rid them of \nworms at this tme it is very much to be desired this can be accomplished \nby giving Claytons Vermifuge as it is a safe remedy and can be given to \npuppies at ten days old any breed The Vermifuge should never be given \noftener than once a week It is a good plan to give all puppies the Vermi \nfuge say once a week from ten days old until they are three months old \nas you are then absolutely sure your puppies are free from worms and \nbarring all contagious diseases will soon arrive at the teething period \n\nNow what I have written and furnished you in the foregoing is meant \nfor Stomach or Round Worms especally Any of these Vermifuges might \nalso expel tape worm but I now treat of it and a remedy that is certain \nsafe and sure one made and intended to be used on humans for tape \nworm but adapted to and used on the dog by the writer \n\nTape Worm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Symptoms of Tape Worm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d An irregular and frequently \na ravenous appetite coexisting with considerable emaciation the food taken \nseeming to do the dog no good The breath is offensive and nose hot and \ndry The coat has a rough harsh staring unhealthy look the hair looking \ndead I have however found tape worms in a pug dog that had a sleek \nand glossy coat and was fat and healthy They often have a depraved ap \npetite looking for and eating filth Parts of the worm may sometimes be \nseen hanging from the anus of the dog this being the case in the pug spoken \nof and who had never shown any signs of having such trouble as she was \na bitch that had had several litters of pups \n\nI prefer mixing it in molasses as this is sweet and also a physic It \nshould work him in from half an hour to an hour but sometimes takes \nlonger \n\nAnother way to give it is by mixing the powder in castor or olive oil \nthe way it is given by doctors in treating human beings for tape worm \n\nNow arrange to have it so you can examine the passages by dog being \nconfined in a yard Be there yourself till it has worked the dog dont give \nit up and go away for this catching tape worms is not easy fishing and you \nmust give it your attention Examine each stool and carefully pick out \nthe part of worm it may contain wash this off and put it on a sheet of \npaper so you can examine it and see what luck you had in that haul or if \nyou got the head that time You can buy at a small cost a magnifying glass \nas the head cannot be seen with the naked eye As soon as medicine is \nthrough working feed up your dog for he will relish a good meal If you \nfind the head then I would let the dog go for a week before you give him \n\nanother dose but if you have not found the head then repeat dose in two \nor three days \n\nIn tape worm cases the treatment must be repeated and persevered \nwith until the head of the worm is expelled and in all cases the worms and \nall discharged feces should be either burned or destroyed by mixing it with \nsome powerful disinfectant and then buried to prevent propagation of the \nparasites by their ova \n\nYou may get one worm or more and yet the dog may have more tape \nworms which treat for later on if symptoms again appear Here is another \nprescription which is recommended by Dalzel \n\nTreatment for Tape Worm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I will now divulge the secret of the rem \nedy that I have sold for years under the name of Eberharts Tape Worm \nRemedy and which has never failed and never will fail to remove tape \nworms head and all if directions are followed Kamala is the article It \nis a product of India a fine granular powder of a reddish brown color \nobtained from the minute glands adhering to the capsules of Rottlera \ntinctoria \n\nSome ten years ago my pug Boycott was afflicted with tape worm not \nonly one but several as is sometimes the case and I tried every known \nremedy and each case failed to rid him of the worms besides nearly ruin \ning the dog I paid one tape worm doctor who treated people ten dollars \nto work on my dog one entire day and lie faied to get the head of the \nworm and the poor dog was sick for many days afterward due to the \nsevere ordeal and treatment I then discovered Kamala which had been \nused for human beings and in less than a week I had removed three tape \nworms including heads aggregating eighty feet in length \n\nKamala is entirely harmless never causing irritation or inflammation \nand unlike other remedies its use does not leave the patient in a weakened \ncondition but exactly the reverse in this respect \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the dog feeling better \nis braced up acts happy and better than before taking it So harmless do \nI know it to be that many times I have given it as an ordinary physic \nwhen I did not have castor oil on hand It is the greatest tape worm \nremedy ever used and I now give up the secret purely for the good of dogs \nas I have sold it for years and am receiving orders for it almost daily \nit having been a profitable part of my business \n\nIt is also a very good remedy for removing round worms Being a com \nparatively new remedy at this writing not all druggists keep it and espe \ncially in smaller towns and if your druggist has not got it send to me \nand I can mail it to you as my druggist in Cincinnati keeps it in stock \nand always fresh which is highly important as it must be fresh and kept \nin a tightly corked bottle For Fifty Cents I can send it by mail \u00e2\u20ac\u201d enough \nusually for any dog This one remedy alone is worth the cost of a good \nmany copies of this book \n\nNever use areca nut the relict of a past age which has for so long a \ntime been used for tape worm and has killed more dogs than it ever cured \na deadly and dangerous remedy \n\nHow to Use Kamala \n\nFast your dog for twentyfour hours a day and a night and then in \n\n\n160 \n\nthe morning give him the dose A strong and mature dog should be kept \nwithout food for twentyfour hours weakly dogs and puppies a less period \nbut sufficient to empty the stomach for it is no use giving vermifuge on a \nfull stomach except to young puppies of course \n\nWeigh your dog and if he is ordinarily strong and healthy the size \ndose to give is two grains for each pound the dog weighs If the dog is \nnot in usual health or is a weakly sort try it first \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one and a half grains \nto each pound Kamala is tasteless and unless the dog gets the idea you \nare giving him medicine it is easily administered as follows I give it \nmixed in molasses and then put it in his mouth rubbing whatever is left \non your finger on his nose and he will lick it off himself \n\nIn using Kamala should you give an overdose no harm will result \nfrom it as it is not a drug An even teaspoonful of Kamala is sixty grains \nand taking this as a guide you can come near enough to the proper dose \nfor any dog if you have the dogs weight as for instance if your dog \nweighed sixty pounds then the dose would be two teaspoonfuls and you \ncan get at it this way or a better plan is to get your druggist to weigh it \nout into proper sized doses telling him weight of dog and that the dose \nis two grains to each pound dog weighs \n\nYou may find difficulty in getting Kamala many druggists not keep \ning it and some of them even not knowing as to it and if you cannot \nobtain it of your druggist I can send it to you by mail two hundred and \nforty grains for fifty cents It must be fresh and what you do not use \nmust be kept in a tight glass stoppered bottle to retain its virtues for fu \nture use Kamala is the greatest tape worm remedy of all I am satis \nfied and sure that it is and since I first made it public in my second edi \ntion of this book several makers of worm remedies are using it in their \nworm preparations One regular physician in Mississippi who had prac \nticed medicine for forty years and who bred hounds not knowing of \nKamala ordered it and later wrote me that from one dog he got eighty \ntwo feet of tape worm and that he should adopt and use Kamala here \nafter in his practice on humans \n\nDalziel says of Tape Worms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d These are as the name indicates the \nflat worms which are often seen evacuated with the feces in small sections \nof half an inch or less when they are usually called mawworms or at \ntimes chains of them may be seen hanging from the anus when being \nexpelled naturally or under the action of medicine \n\nNo less than a dozen tapeworms select the dog as their host They \nhave a remarkable lifehistory and it is as well for the dog owner to \nknow something as to this as he is often puzzled to think how this or \nthat dog became infested \n\nIt will therefore be well to see how an adult tape worm is made up \nIf examined it will be found to consist of a head or scolex and a series \nof segments scientifically known as metameres These latter are con \nstantly being budded off from the head and assume forms varying with \ntheir age Thus those nearest the head are the youngest and those at \nthe other extremity the oldest It is these last which one sees from time \nto time pass with the faecal discharges They are in fact the ripe segments \nor proglottids which detach themselves from the hind portion and each \nportion thus freed is endowed with reproductive organs In tim these \n\n\n\u00e2 \n\ndetached portions die away but the eggs contained In them have been \nimpregnated by spermatozoa and simply await another host to begin anew \nthe cycle of existence The eggs thus scattered broadcast are not influ \n\u00e2\u20ac enced by extremes of heat or cold dryness or moisture nor does time seem \nto destroy their germinating power From this it will readily be seen \nhow important it is to burn all excreta from dogs infested with tape worms \nWhen the ripe segments leave the dog per anus they are charged with \nova and possessing the power of motion wriggle among the hair where \nthe lice and fleas devour the eggs and develop into the cryptocysts found \nby Grassi free in the abdominal cavity The dog again in searching for \nhis tormentors nibbles and licks his skin and coat and in this way swal \nlows the insect and when the contained cryptocyst is set free in the dogs \nstomach the tapeworm is once more developed The nimble flea travels \nso readily from one dog to another carrying this tape worm with him \nthat we have here an explanation of what has puzzled so many \u00e2\u20ac\u201d how a \ncarefully fed and groomed house dog becomes infested with tape worm",
    "Maw Worms": "Maw Worms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Treatment for Maw Worms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d These can be reached and \nexpelled by the following injection per rectum Aloes 1 dram Put the \naloes into a tea cup of warm water and then put it into a bottle Inject \nonce every day until no more are to be seen passing from the dog Use \nrubber syringe and hold rear part of the dog up for five minutes after \ninjecting It will do no harm and facilitate matters by having given an \nhour beforehand a dose of Kamala see tape worm as the Kamala will \ngive dog a thorough cleaning out and with this start expel a lot of these \nworms The Kamala need only be given once in treating for maw worms \n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d the first day you begin treating dog \n\nAnother good injection for rectum or maw worms is a solution of \nquassia chips A handful steeped in water for six hours"
