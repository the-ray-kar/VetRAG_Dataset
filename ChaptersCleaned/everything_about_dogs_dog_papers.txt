DOG  PAPERS  YOU  NEED 


There  are  several  published  devoted  to  dogs.  (I  take  them  all),  and 
even  if  you  only  own  one  dog,  it  will  be  of  great  benefit  to  you  to  read  these 
dog  journals: 

"Field  and  Fancy,"  (weekly),  you  can't  well  do  without. 

"American  Fancier,"  edited  by  Harry  W.  Lacy,  comes  out  fifty-two  times 
a  year,  and  as  a  fearless  writer  is  not  surpassed  by  any  one. 

"Dogdom,"  a  handsomely  gotten  up  monthly  magazine,  profusely  il- 
lustrated, is  the  best  dollar  investment  a  dog  owner  can  make. 

Then  there  is  "The  Dog  Fancier,"  another  monthly,  published  for  many 
years  by  Eugene  Glass,  Battle  Creek,  Mich.,  full  of  dog  news,  and  costs 
only  a  dollar. 

"The  American  Field,  (weekly),  the  oldest  dog  paper  of  all,  their 
specialty  is  hunting  dogs,  and  if  you  are  interested  in  sporting  dogs,  you 
can't  afford  to  not  get  this  paper. 

A  new  monthly,  "Dog  "World,"  handsomely  gotten  up  and  very  read- 
able, costs  only  a  dollar  a  year. 

"Hounds  and  Hunting,"  devoted  to  Beagles  and  Hounds,  is  just  the 
paper  for  anyone  interested  in  these  breeds,  to  read. 

All  these  papers  have  advertisements  in  the  book,  but  if  you  prefer 
you  can  remit  the  subscription  price  to  me,  and  I  will  see  that  you  get 
the  paper.
