      "\n",
      "*   The author expresses strong disbelief in hydrophobia, citing personal experiences of being bitten by dogs displaying symptoms of the disease without contracting it.\n",
      "*   The author criticizes the overuse of the term \"germs\" by doctors and veterinarians and questions the existence of hydrophobia germs.\n",
      "*   The author suggests a simple method of sucking the blood from a dog bite immediately and spitting it out, or using Peroxyde of Hydrogen, to prevent blood poisoning.\n",
      "*   The author argues that fear and panic contribute to the belief and manifestation of hydrophobia symptoms.\n",
      "*   The author advises against killing a dog that has bitten someone, suggesting instead that the dog be confined and observed to determine if it was truly mad.\n",

      "*   The views of Dr. H. Clay Glover, who claims that the mad dog scare is a myth, are presented.\n",
